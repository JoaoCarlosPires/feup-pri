However, he's made the mistake of trying to put Jerry to work, as a serving boy, a corkscrew, and other tasks. Jerry puts up with a little of this, but mostly gets revenge on Tom, mostly involving the tip of Tom's tail, which ends up in a sandwich, inside a dessert, and in a candle-holder. Meanwhile, Toots isn't too happy about Tom getting fresh with her. There's a chase, of course, featuring Tom stabbing a turkey while Jerry, safely outside, makes sounds of pain. Tom ends up with his tail stuck up like a mast as Jerry paints \"S.S. Drip\" on his side and Toots launches him into the punchbowl with a bottle of champagne.", "popularity": 2.394, "poster_path": "/zjTCSI7Mk1Obr1i1AjNAbIwOk8.jpg", "release_date": "1945-05-05", "title": "The Mouse Comes to Dinner", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 25}
