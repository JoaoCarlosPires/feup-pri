Now drunk, Tom staggers around in the house getting up to no good with Jerry, clearing out the fridge, making a mess, waking Mammy-Two-Shoes. You can tell this will only end in severe punishment, but Tom simply casts caution to the wind and gets even more drunk by downing a bottle of rum he finds in the bathroom. Obviously, everyone has a bottle of rum in their bathroom.", "popularity": 2.227, "poster_path": "/b8AIKY090m7Cl3FrGHxovvG4vUn.jpg", "release_date": "1947-03-15", "title": "Part Time Pal", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 20}
