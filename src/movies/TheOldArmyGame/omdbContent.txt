But his clever ruse (a dummy and a sound effects record) don't fool Sergeant Pete, who's waiting for him when he sneaks back in. Donald hides in one of three boxes and plays the shell game for a while, until Pete throws the box with Donald along the top of a sharp fence, sawing it in half. Donald lands in a hole, and both he and Pete think he's been sawed in half, for a while. Donald discovers he's OK, but his joy is shortlived when Pete gives chase (a chase slowed considerably by the 35 MPH national speed limit).", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBkZGI0NTUtYjllNS00MjIzLWJlMTEtNzVhZjdiNGEwOTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk3NDAwMzI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "492", "imdbID": "tt0036231", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
