Tweety seeks shelter from a blizzard and taps on Granny's house door. Sylvester answers and grabs the canary. He tries to hide Tweety from Granny while evading the attacks of Hector, Granny's bed-ridden bulldog, who wants revenge on Sylvester for his broken leg. Tweety keeps escaping Sylvester's clutches, with Hector's help.", "popularity": 1.593, "poster_path": "/z0hHizoYeOEsy07RV1XK8r7E4Oq.jpg", "release_date": "1953-09-04", "title": "A Street Cat Named Sylvester", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 8}
