"An alright sequel.\r\n\r\nIt's a more watered down story regarding Ming-Na Wen's character, with more focus put on lovey-dovey stuff as opposed to a fight of some kind. Therefore, things are naturally less enjoyable than in the original film. To me, everything's just a little slow and predictable so I can't rate it higher.\r\n\r\nAway from Wen, the supporting cast is weaker with the absence of Eddie Murphy as Mushu. Mark Moseley actually comes in with an OK performance, yet it's not a jot on Murphy's. There are some notable newcomers though, with Lucy Liu (Mei) and Sandra Oh (Ting-Ting) appearing.\r\n\r\nThe music is average, as is the animation. It's simply a weaker production all in all, as you would probably predict. 'Mulan II' is, at least, still better than a number of other Disney animated sequels; e.g. <em>'Cinderella II: Dreams Come True'</em> or <em>'Belle\u2019s Magical World'</em>, among others.""\n"
