Luffy continuously ordered meals, right when the crew is in need of more money. Nami overhears a conversation between a pirate and the bartender at the bar they're at. About a way in getting more money, the pirate gave him 200 Belli and was lead secretly out of the bar. So Nami talks to the bartender, about their money problem. The bartender knows that they are a group of pirates, but isn't sure if a group of amateurs like them would be eligible on the secret spot. Since Nami insisted on giving the bartender, 200 Belli, he directed them to the back of the bar on where the secret spot is. Soon they find themselves in an underground pirate community where pirates of all kinds are partying, drinking, eating, and socializing. That's when our heroes learn about the \"Dead End Race\" which is held every few years here in Anabaru. With the grand prize being 300,000,000 Belli, Nami finds that to be more than enough to end the Straw Hat Pirates money trouble. But little do they know is that the whole race is a conspiracy, that's linked to an ex-marine commander pirate named Gasparde who has a 95,000,000 Belli bounty on his head. And not to mention Shuraiya, a bounty hunter with a grudge against Gasparde. And a kid named Anaguma, who is the helper of Biera(the boiler room operator for Gasparde's ship) is trying to find a way to help Biera get better from his poor condition. All these events collide as the \"Dead End Race\" begins.", "Language": "Italian, Japanese", "Country": "Japan", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDExNjM1NmQtNjkxZi00N2Q5LWFjNjItOGVkMTUzNTFkYWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjAwMzU2MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "1,728", "imdbID": "tt1006926", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
