"In DC's mad rush to get the lion's share of their animated films under one umbrella, ore more accurately, into a single timeline, there was always going to be at least a slight re-duplication of efforts. But seeing as this is almost **exactly** the same as the already released _Superman: Doomsday_ movie, I wonder, did _The Death of Superman_ really need to happen? Or if it did, could it have maybe been one part of a bigger story? Or maybe at least have like... happened later? I suppose, that seeing as this movie is a much better version of it, I can't complain too much... Even if we did just have to also sit through another bastardised version of it in _Batman v Superman_.\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, with the exception of _Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay_, probably the best movie in the new \"DC Animated Movie Universe\". But the movies outside of this rushed, ham-fisted continuity are usually far better, so the compliment's not too high a praise.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._""\n"
