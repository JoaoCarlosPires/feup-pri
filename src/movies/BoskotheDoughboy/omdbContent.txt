Bullets and bombs are everywhere. (A bomb even blows up the title card.) Bosko and his fellow infantrymen are hardly safe in their trench. Bosko is happily eating from a pan full of beans when a bomb hits the pan and destroys his meal. Bosko misses Honey; he pulls out her picture and kisses it. A cannonball tears through it, making her head a gaping hole. Now Bosko is angry. He vows revenge but the moment his helmet appears above the trench, it's hit with dozens of bullets, knocking him back down. Another soldier (a horse) briefly cheers him up with harmonica music. Bosko gets his chance to be a hero when his buddy (a hippo) swallows a cannonball.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ0ZWFiYzctMmZmZS00MmFiLTkzMTMtZTkwNDA2MDUwMTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgyODgxNjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.7", "imdbVotes": "222", "imdbID": "tt0021687", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
