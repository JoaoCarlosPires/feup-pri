"The idea is clearly an evolution of what Shrek meant.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the script and dialogues are not so brilliant. It was boring for a big deal of the time and there were too many things going on and too fast.\r\n\r\nYou can recognize Genndy Tartakovsky's style in the movie but I've liked other of his works much more than this.""\n""Oh. This was... **super** underwhelming. Like I mean, I was prepared to appreciate it less than the majority of audiences, I often don't love kids' media, and I'm not really a fan of Adam Sandler, but I didn't think that I wouldn't find any appeal in it **at all**. This is just one I genuinely do not see what people are talking about when they give it a favourable review. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._""\n"
