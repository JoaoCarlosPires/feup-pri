Third of Tetsuzo's four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father's talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. \"We're father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.\"", "popularity": 6.36, "poster_path": "/dgN11TAkzmcK9QNSKbspqOreneX.jpg", "release_date": "2015-05-09", "title": "Miss Hokusai", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 91}
