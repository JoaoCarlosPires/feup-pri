Frank Martin turns down a job in Marseilles, referring it to a pal. A short time later, the pal, wounded by gunfire, crashes his car into Frank's living room and dies, leaving a young woman in the back seat. The employer of the dead man shows up, forces Frank to take the job, snaps a bracelet on his wrist that will explode if Frank gets more than 75 feet from his car, and sends Frank on a journey east with the young woman and a trunk full of something. She's Valentina, nearly mute. Can Frank figure out what's going on, deliver the package, and escape alive? And what does the ship have to do with it?", "Language": "English, French, Ukrainian, Russian, Hungarian", "Country": "France, United States, Ukraine, United Kingdom", "Awards": "2 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzg1OTU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjcyMjI5MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.1/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "40%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "51/100"}], "Metascore": "51", "imdbRating": "6.1", "imdbVotes": "162,509", "imdbID": "tt1129442", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "10 Mar 2009", "BoxOffice": "$31,715,062", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
