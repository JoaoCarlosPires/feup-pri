"Mad God is a terrifying triumph to animation. It is mesmerizing, unique, and disgusting through and through. The ruined city in the film is coated in these overwhelming layers of grunge and unknown fluids that practically ooze onto the audience. The film seems to draw homage from the Labyrinth Cenobites reside in from the Hellraiser films. Apart from taking away that we\u2019re all doomed to repeat the same pain and anguish for eternity, Mad God\u2019s one flaw is reasoning behind its gruesome existence. Dreams and aspirations lead us through life like a treasure map, which more often than not, never come true. There\u2019s nothing out there quite like Mad God. It is frighteningly phantasmagorical and a horrific masterpiece of animation.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Fantasia-Mad-God-Review""\n"
