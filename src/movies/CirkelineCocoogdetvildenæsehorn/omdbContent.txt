Her name is Coco and she looks exactly like Circleen - only she has black skin, curly hair and wears a crown. She is a princess, and she tells Cirkeline that she comes from the country where chocolate grows on the trees. Now, that's a place Circleen's two friends, Ingolf and Frederik, would love to visit. Granddad knows Africa like the back of his hand, and so they set off on his aeroplane, taking OSWALD along too: a teeny-weeny, fiery-tempered rhinoceros who's sick and tired of being bossed around by the big ones. He causes our friends no end of trouble. Cirkeline, Princess Coco and this wild little rhinoceros give us a story of friendship and the trials and tribulations of being the little one.", "Language": "Danish", "Country": "Denmark", "Awards": "1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFjMDA5NGQtMzI1Ni00MTY3LWIxZjktZTZkNjliZGM5NDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDA5NjIzMg@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "4.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "4.4", "imdbVotes": "13", "imdbID": "tt7886598", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
