The two men fancy Daffy as a duck dinner and chase him around the cabin. Daffy tells them he is a cookbook salesman with a complimentary turkey dinner. The men let Daffy go and sit down to feast on turkey, but a group of famished mice suddenly appear and devour the bird before the men can raise a knife to carve. When Daffy returns to try to sell the men some after-dinner mints, they resume their hungry chase of Daffy.", "popularity": 1.176, "poster_path": "/lpX6gwWjYsTefq9AJ4qnMTmSG53.jpg", "release_date": "1947-06-03", "title": "Along Came Daffy", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 9}
