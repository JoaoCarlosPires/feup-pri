The movie is set while Kirikou is still a child and Karaba is still a sorceress. Like Princes et princesses and Les Contes de la nuit, it is an anthology film comprising several episodic stories, each of them describing Kirikou's interactions with a different animals. It is however unique among Michel Ocelot's films, not only in that it is co-directed by B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Galup (who has previously worked with him as an animator) but also for each of the stories being written by a different person (in all other cases, Ocelot has been the sole writer and director of his films).", "popularity": 8.194, "poster_path": "/ixTVgA2TtUCnYLy9VMhRzkdopUe.jpg", "release_date": "2005-12-07", "title": "Kirikou and the Wild Beasts", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 253}
