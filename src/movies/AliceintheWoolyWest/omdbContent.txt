Some bad guys rob a stagecoach; one of the passengers is Alice, who finds herself stuck between the head bad guy and a cactus. Julius rides in and saves most of the passengers, but the bad guy rides off with Alice. After a short chase, he ends up battling Julius on top of a tall rock outcropping. A piece eventually breaks off, sending both of them into a boulder field. They play hide-and-seek a while. Julius then takes off his fur and sends it out as a decoy while he sneaks up behind the bad guy with a club and beats him into the ground. Alice comes up to thank him; ashamed by his nakedness, he hides behind a rock and puts his fur back on, then accepts her thanks.", "Language": "None, English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGE1ZGZjZjItNjI0YS00ZWEwLTg0NzUtYmQ0ODYzMTQ1MDhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0MzU2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.4", "imdbVotes": "181", "imdbID": "tt0016585", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
