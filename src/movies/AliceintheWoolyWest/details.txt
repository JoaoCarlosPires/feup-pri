Some bad guys rob a stagecoach; one of the passengers is Alice, who finds herself stuck between the head bad guy and a cactus. Julius rides in and saves most of the passengers, but the bad guy rides off with Alice. After a short chase, he ends up battling Julius on top of a tall rock outcropping. A piece eventually breaks off, sending both of them into a boulder field. They play hide-and-seek a while. Julius then takes off his fur and sends it out as a decoy while he sneaks up behind the bad guy with a club and beats him into the ground. Alice comes up to thank him; ashamed by his nakedness, he hides behind a rock and puts his fur back on, then accepts her thanks.", "popularity": 1.53, "poster_path": "/jQ4Qsn2E4vpF1PKKfpZ6FEh9WWV.jpg", "release_date": "1926-10-03", "title": "Alice in the Wooly West", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.2, "vote_count": 3}
