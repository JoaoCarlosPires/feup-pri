"Pretty weird decision to make a movie with a female character in the lead, stock it chock full of female supporting roles, then title it \"_Superman/Batman_\", but okay. Guess I should just be glad it got made at all, especially way back in 2010. The film itself? It's alright, has that bizarre simplistic-yet-confusing combo that you'd think is such an oxymoron it'd be impossible to hit but superhero fare pretty frequently stumbles in to, but at least it's not **completely** paint by numbers.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._""\n"
