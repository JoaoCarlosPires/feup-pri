The film features some very creative imagery, a groovy 70's jazz score, and very little spoken dialogue. It's a story about a dog named Joe that falls in love with a rose and protects it from a mean spirited crow. There's some energetic Fritz Freeling style action. There's also some unexpectedly grim tragedy, not including the anticipated outcome, which does occur as expected.", "popularity": 0.96, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1977-03-01", "title": "The Rose And Joe", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 4}
