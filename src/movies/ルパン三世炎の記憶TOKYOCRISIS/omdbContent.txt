Unfortunately, two of his partners aren't in good condition at the moment: marksman Daisuke Jigen is suffering from a toothache that impedes his aim, and swordsman Goemon Ishikawa has had his prized sword stolen from him... and in Suzuki's collection! Meanwhile, Inspector Zenigata must reluctantly deal with Maria, a journalist assigned to report on the Lupin case but who would much rather report on Suzuki.
