The only moment in his drab life that's out of the ordinary each year seems to be opening the birthday card and gift from his mother. Usually it's a tie, but one year it's an accordion. It goes into the closet with his many ties. A year or two later, he discovers what happens to the papers he processes every day. His discovery sends him first to the building's top floor, then to his closet.", "popularity": 1.332, "poster_path": "/x9MRBnLZQ0rnTxCKMZstYBguiZx.jpg", "release_date": "2008-08-28", "title": "The Necktie", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 8}
