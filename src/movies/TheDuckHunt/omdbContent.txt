They clown around a bit. Then they march off, with Pluto's fleas following in formation, which lures a few ducks to follow. As soon as Mickey turns around and sees the ducks, they fly off. He heads for his blind, out-fitting Pluto with a decoy on his head. The ducks buy it, but Mickey has trouble with his shotgun, ultimately shooting a hole in the bottom of his boat and having the gun disintegrate. The ducks see this, and unmask Pluto. Sensing vulnerability, they recruit more ducks, and fly off with Pluto and Mickey. Mickey drags on windmills and rooftops, and finally both of them drop into long underwear hanging on a line (with Pluto's fleas using little parachutes).", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzY4NWQ4ZmItODMyMi00MGYyLWI5MWQtZTBjZGFiYjM5OWVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIxMDUyOTI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "330", "imdbID": "tt0022844", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
