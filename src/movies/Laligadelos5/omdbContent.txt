Imagine what it's like to have an alliance with a \"Catrina\" skeleton, a Mayan warrior, a girly ghost, and a (short) lucha-libre fighter. These are known as the best superheroes of Mexico, but that was a long time ago. A young man with spicy powers, named Chema, must work with these fame-ridden heroes and form the \"League of 5\" in order to rescue his kidnapped sister, named Dolores, and stop the evil plans of Tin Marin, a mastermind with pyrotechnic controls who has the ability to summon monsters using the power of a superhero.
