{"Title": "Queer Duck: The Movie", "Year": "2006", "Rated": "Not Rated", "Released": "18 Jul 2006", "Runtime": "72 min", "Genre": "Animation, Comedy, Musical", "Director": "Xeth Feinberg", "Writer": "Mike Reiss", "Actors": "Jim J. Bullock, Jackie Hoffman, Kevin Michael Richardson, Billy West", "Plot": "Queer Duck: The Movie is the relentlessly funny, feature-length extension of the animated series Queer Duck, created by frequent The Simpsons scripter Mike Reiss. Sexually scandalous yet sweet, the movie is a cascade of pop-culture stereotypes of gays in America, punctuated by rapid-fire references (as with The Simpsons) to, well, just about everything: classic movies, game shows, Gilbert and Sullivan, Paul Lynde. Hey, there's even a storyline: Queer Duck (voiced by Jim J. Bullock) and his partner of 18 months (\"That's a lifetime in gay years\"), Harvey Fierstein sound-alike Stephen Arlo \"Openly\" Gator (Kevin Michael Richardson), hit a relationship crisis when the fey fowl is wooed by a brassy Broadway broad. Queer Duck wonders if he'd be happier being straight. While Gator the waiter spills his problems to a compassionate Conan O'Brien (thanks for the cameo), Queer Duck goes on a personal odyssey that ultimately leads to a showdown with a television evangelist at a theme park re-christened Fairyland. One has to see it to believe it. --Tom Keogh", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMzYyOTkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQwMzMzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.4", "imdbVotes": "968", "imdbID": "tt0485288", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "18 Jul 2006", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
