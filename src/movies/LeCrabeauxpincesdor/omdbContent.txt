I'm assuming that this one that I'm reviewing is the same one that I saw when I was really young. Since only Tintin fans are even going to look up this movie, then I don't have to explain the story. But the one that I saw was in color, I read that this one was black and white, and that it came from Belgium (although I guess that they could have dubbed it). Oh well. I guess that I can only assume that it's the same movie. And I liked it even though it didn't follow the book exactly, as none of the Tintin movies did. If nothing else, it's still nice entertainment for children, with some stuff about geopolitics.", "Language": "French", "Country": "Belgium", "Awards": "1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2OTA5NDQ0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk0NzQ3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.8", "imdbVotes": "135", "imdbID": "tt0260830", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
