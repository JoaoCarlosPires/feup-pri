"A few decent moments, but <em>'Doug\u2019s 1st Movie'</em> is largely flat.\r\n\r\nIf you like the television series from Nickelodeon/Disney then you'll probably enjoy this, though for those who haven't - including me - it's a meh watch. The animation is average, while the voice cast are mostly fine but some are a little irritating. Plot-wise it's basic and rather predictable.\r\n\r\nTom McHugh (Doug) and Constance Shulman (Patti) are alright in their respective roles, though Fred Newman is kinda annoying as Skeeter. The film doesn't do anything to make you actually care for the characters, so I can cut the cast some slack in that regard.\r\n\r\nThere's not really much more to note. Some will like this, some won't... I can understand both sides to be fair. For me, though, it is all too slow.""\n"
