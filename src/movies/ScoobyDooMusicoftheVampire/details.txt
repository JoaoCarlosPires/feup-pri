At first it looks as if they\u2019re in for some fun and lots of Southern snacks, but events soon turn scary when a real live vampire comes to life, bursts from his coffin and threatens all the townsfolk. On top of that, this baritone blood sucker seems intent on taking Daphne as his vampire bride! Could the vampire be a descendant of a famous vampire hunter who is trying to sell his book? Or perhaps he\u2019s the local politician, who has been trying to make his name in the press by attacking the vampires as downright unwholesome. The answers are to be found in a final song-filled showdown in the swamp in which our heroes unmask one of their most macabre monsters yet.", "popularity": 13.243, "poster_path": "/4JvEyQke4gQSSImml50vsa0KQdS.jpg", "release_date": "2012-03-13", "title": "Scooby-Doo!
