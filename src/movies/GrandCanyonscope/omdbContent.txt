Donald tends to be a thorn in the ranger's side, bothering Native sand painters, borrowing a rain dance outfit heralding the inevitable raincloud, and getting into an argument with his own echo in Echo Canyon. Eventually, Donald loses track of his burro and his search for the lost animal disturbs an irate mountain lion who chases Donald and Woodlore around the landmark ultimately reducing the attraction to a pile of rubble. The ranger, unamused by this, insists that Donald and the lion return the landmark to its original state!", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRmNDI4ZDktYjc4My00YjZkLTg4NWQtMTg4NGY0N2ZmNDEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0MzU2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "599", "imdbID": "tt0047043", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
