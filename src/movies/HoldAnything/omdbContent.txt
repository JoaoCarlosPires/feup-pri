The mice laying bricks dance as they work. Bosko uses a handsaw to decapitate a mouse and then bounce the mouse's head and its body (which is frantically trying to retrieve the head) even higher. Later, the reconnected mouse and a rivet-eating goat send a beam up to Bosko, who rides it high into the air. From this lofty position, he spots Honey in her high-rise apartment. He plucks musical notes out of the ropes of a pulley, and then uses the floating notes to step from his beam into the apartment. He puts sheet music in Honey's typewriter, and types out music as if it were a piano. Honey dances to the music, periodically disconnecting her torso from her legs. Bosko grabs the goat, which is now filled with hot air and floating like a balloon, and plays it like bagpipes. But a sudden spray of goat's milk knocks Bosko to the ground, splitting him into several selves, which play the bricks on a wall like piano keys.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmRkZGYxMjEtZmMyYi00NDc2LTg0NTItNmRhNTAyYjk4ZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxMzM3NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.5", "imdbVotes": "242", "imdbID": "tt0020983", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
