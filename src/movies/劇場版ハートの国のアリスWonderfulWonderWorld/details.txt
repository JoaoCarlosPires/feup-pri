A parody of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland where Alice is smart and non-doormatlike.  In this story, Alice is not all what she seems. She is practical, strong, yet darkly cynical.

Stuck in Heartland due to a trick by the mysterious bunny eared man, she meets the residents of this world. Along the way, Alice meets Blood, handsome mafia leader; Ace, the psycho yet charming knight and more\u2026What should Alice do in such a world!?
