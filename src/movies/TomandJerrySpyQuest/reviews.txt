"Talk about a \"hidden gem\". This is yet another Hanna Barbera Mashup if you will of two different cartoon series, much like the Scooby Doo meets Batman movie from the 1970's. In this version you have the action adventure of Jonny Quest paired with the antics of Tom and Jerry, where i ask you where can you go wrong? All i know is that is a great movie for those who are looking for a cartoon treat, as well as cartoon lovers in general. What are you waiting for? Go watch it.""\n"
