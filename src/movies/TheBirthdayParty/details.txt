The chef brings out the cake (with 2 candles); Mickey manages to blow all the cake onto the chef's face, while the candles stay lit. He unwraps his present: a miniature piano. He plays a duet of I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby with Minnie, followed by an instrumental version of The Darktown Strutter's Ball, which everyone dances to (including Mickey and Minnie, while the piano stools keep playing). Mickey then plays There's No Place Like Home on the xylophone, then accompanies Minnie on another piece, after which the xylophone gets frisky and eventually dumps Mickey in the fish bowl.", "popularity": 2.901, "poster_path": "/T1xky4oLynbgdbahKU4gFixwBf.jpg", "release_date": "1931-01-07", "title": "The Birthday Party", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 19}
