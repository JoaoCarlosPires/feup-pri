Meanwhile, across the studio, Max is animating Koko. When he's called over to consult on the too-accurate bust, Koko gets mischievous and creates his own drawings. He then escapes and crawls inside the clay bust, eventually wriggling off like an inchworm. He gets into a fight with the man being modelled, both of them flinging wads of clay.", "popularity": 1.672, "poster_path": "/rJe6LUlqz3jfV6HugfTBr71PtQ1.jpg", "release_date": "1921-10-08", "title": "Modeling", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 9}
