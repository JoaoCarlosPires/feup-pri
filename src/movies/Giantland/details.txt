He starts with the climbing of the beanstalk; after evading the giant a few times, he ends up inside a cheese sandwich, and then in the giant's mouth, where he ultimately grabs onto a pipe and gets pulled out by the giant. In the ensuing chase, Mickey launches a pepper bomb to slow the giant down, then outruns him coming down the beanstalk and sets the stalk on fire.", "popularity": 1.452, "poster_path": "/jdY1CS5fIjz4Sfo8bRcRMNuciRn.jpg", "release_date": "1933-11-25", "title": "Giantland", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 17}
