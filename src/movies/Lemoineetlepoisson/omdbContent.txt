First the monk uses a rod and reel, then a net; over and over, he ends up fish-less and wet. Sleepless, he tries luring the fish at night with a bank of candles. He tries a bow and arrow. The tireless and insouciant fish leads the monk through a viaduct, over irrigated steppes, across cisterns, down canals. Suddenly, the monk's chase and the fish's teasing flight become a spiritual journey.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 4 wins & 2 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM5NzYyNDMtODJkZS00NWNjLTgwZDUtY2EyNzQxYmI4ZDY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU2MTMyOTU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "1,222", "imdbID": "tt0110547", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
