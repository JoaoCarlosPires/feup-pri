First the monk uses a rod and reel, then a net; over and over, he ends up fish-less and wet. Sleepless, he tries luring the fish at night with a bank of candles. He tries a bow and arrow. The tireless and insouciant fish leads the monk through a viaduct, over irrigated steppes, across cisterns, down canals. Suddenly, the monk's chase and the fish's teasing flight become a spiritual journey.", "popularity": 1.679, "poster_path": "/i6TKP4Mt2cKHVhRtHQg4qkIurNo.jpg", "release_date": "1994-01-01", "title": "The Monk and the Fish", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 38}
