Bugs Bunny manages to stop a turtle (by blocking its path with a shovel) and asks him what all the excitement is about. \"The Tasmanian devil is on the loose!\" cries the turtle. Bugs looks up \"Tasmanian devil\" in his encyclopedia and discovers that it's a \"strong murderous beast\" that eats just about any animal. It doesn't mention rabbits, and so the Tasmanian devil, who has been reading over Bugs's shoulder, pencils in \"rabbits\" himself. Bugs calmly asks, \"What's up, doc?\" He then spends the day tricking the wild, snorting, snarling beast with a bubble-gum chicken, a decoy deer, a giant slingshot and finally a classified ad in the Tasmanian Post-Dispatch.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3ZWU0MGQtNWI0NS00MzEzLWFjN2MtMGI5NGFiZGVkNTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc2NTQzMjU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.6/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.6", "imdbVotes": "1,481", "imdbID": "tt0046908", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$14,753", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
