She runs away from home and, together with a dog and a horse, finds a (mad? nutty?) scientist in a windmill. They experience the strangest adventures in this windmill and find other interesting characters, a lot of excitement and peril.  While you may well interpret something as the \"socialist value system\" into this movie, it is more meant to be a children's movie, showing the kids that there are more exciting things out there than the ones that your parents and teachers show you, and that you will only find out most of those things on your own, if you show enough curiosity.", "popularity": 1.12, "poster_path": "/ahCqx6KG2vv8I3rxynUxTt3yfsX.jpg", "release_date": "1982-04-09", "title": "Die fliegende Windm\u00fchle", "video": false, "vote_average": 5, "vote_count": 1}
