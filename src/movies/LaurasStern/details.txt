The star is a living being, and Laura takes her home to reattach its point with a band-aid. The little star has special powers and can make people fly, or bring inanimate objects to life. But the more she stays on Earth, the weaker she becomes and her colors fade away and her powers start to fail. Laura must find a way to send the little star back into outer space.", "popularity": 2.74, "poster_path": "/6MmTM4LYJqjw5agrTwjBSpSNgTm.jpg", "release_date": "2004-09-19", "title": "Laura's Star", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 33}
