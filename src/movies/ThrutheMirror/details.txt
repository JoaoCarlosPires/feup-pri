He finds himself on the other side of the mirror, where the furniture is alive. He eats a walnut, which makes him briefly larger, then small. He dances around a lot, ultimately doing a major number with a deck of cards. He dances with the queen, making the king jealous. He comes after Mickey with swords, and Mickey defends himself with a sewing needle. Mickey gets the upper hand, and the king calls for reinforcements. Mickey finds himself chased by several decks, which throw their spots at him. He turns on a fan and blows them away, back through the mirror, where his alarm is ringing.", "popularity": 5.875, "poster_path": "/x8Ubmsg852lAGmfrBJhPLIqyF5a.jpg", "release_date": "1936-05-30", "title": "Thru the Mirror", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 91}
