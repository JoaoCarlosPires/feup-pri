A skunk tries to buy a ticket, costing a nickel, but he only has one scent. He looks for a way to sneak in. Meanwhile, Porky introduces the show: a collection of cartoons, drawn as stick figures. At the end, the audience is all gone because the skunk managed to sneak in. Porky's cartoons include: Circus Parade, Choo-Choo Train, Soldiers (Marchin), Horse Race, and Dances (hula, Mexican hat, and ballet). All accompanied by a self-parody musical score.", "popularity": 1.325, "poster_path": "/oM2YCgWdxLo20Udx7roTi6S9WJT.jpg", "release_date": "1941-04-19", "title": "Porky's Preview", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 11}
