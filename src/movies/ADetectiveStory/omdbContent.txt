When the phone rings, Ash promises to his cat Dinah he will quit the business forever if this is yet another husband who wants his wife shadowed. But the caller is quite a different gentleman. He wants Ash to look for a computer hacker called Trinity. The caller refuses to say his name, but Ash is quickly persuaded to take on the job when he sees his recently updated bank account balance.
