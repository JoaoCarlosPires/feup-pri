"It's nice to hear Matt Ryan voice Constantine again after his short tenure as the Hellblazer. It's also cool to see the oft-shunned Deadman get some attention, and I'll always give Batman-starring media a chance. But I have not been a fan of DC's more recent animated offerings. I feel they are simply going through the motions, and _Justice League Dark_ is no great exception.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n"
