"I don't like this as much as most do, but <em>'The Incredibles'</em> is definitely a fun watch.\r\n\r\nI enjoy how the film starts out, as it introduces the characters and tells some backstories. However, once the film becomes more serious it kinda loses its edge for me. When it's less so though, it's good. The animation is very nice, even if the humans look a tad iffy especially with their expressions.\r\n\r\nAnother part I don't love is the villain, Syndrome. I feel like he's a bit tame, I never once felt fear/angst from the guy at all. A much more devilish, deceptive bad guy would've been far better. I didn't even realise it's Jason Lee who voices him either, it oddly doesn't sound like Lee to me.\r\n\r\nTalking of mishearing the voice cast, am I the only one who thought it was Jodie Foster voicing Elastigirl? Violet kinda sounds like Aubrey Plaza too. I think I may need my ears tested... Elsewhere, it's cool to hear (correctly, this time) Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this is certainly a film worth watching 100%. I just would've loved a greater threat to the protagonists. Lastly, the end scenes, though amusing, feel like a collective of end credit jokes rolled into one. That's a minor complaint, mind.""\n"
