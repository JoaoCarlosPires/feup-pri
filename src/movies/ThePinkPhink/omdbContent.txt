So, the Pink Panther obtains a bucket of pink paint and begins painting the wall with his preferred color. The hot-tempered man doesn't at first realize that his work is being painted over by the panther, but when he does, he grabs a rifle and shoots at the pink cat. The Pink Panther pours his pink paint into the man's rifle, and with each shot that the man fires, gobs of pink paint splatter on the building, turning it entirely pink!
