"These straight-to-video LEGO movies are never very good, but I liked the approach in this one of telling a more personal story. It was still goofy and shallow brand promotion peppered with some really bad jokes like all the others, but at least there was some character beyond \"Hey remember Batman? Hey remember Superman? We do too! Here are some pictures of them in LEGO form!\" to be found in this one.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n"
