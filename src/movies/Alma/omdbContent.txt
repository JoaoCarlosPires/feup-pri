Next to it, a wall with various names scribbled on it, which in Alma's bright eyes seems sleek and towering and utterly inviting. So without much thought, the girl puts effort into writing her name in flawless cursive, when all of a sudden, an almost perfect miniature image of herself appears, staring at her through the storefront window. And then, as if by magic, the shop's door opens, welcoming the awed girl to witness firsthand the wonders inside the small and crammed with toys store.
