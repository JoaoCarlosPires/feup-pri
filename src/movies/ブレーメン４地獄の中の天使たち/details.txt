Though based on the \"Band of Bremen (Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten)\", Tezuka Osamu's fans could easily associate the story with \"The Amazing Three.\" The cat, dog, donkey, and chicken who transform into human beings with the power of spacemen and fight to save the earth are entirely reminiscent of the three characters in the \"Amazing Three\" who transform themselves into animals and devote all their energies to saving the earth.", "popularity": 1.501, "poster_path": "/iB7FQcTGJ33RXcQthk6bSFL0e9H.jpg", "release_date": "1981-08-28", "title": "Bremen 4: Angels in Hell", "video": false, "vote_average": 7, "vote_count": 2}
