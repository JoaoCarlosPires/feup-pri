Bryan", "Plot": "Elmer Fudd buys Bugs Bunny from a meat market as he anticipates a nice rabbit stew. Bugs climbs out of his basket to tell him he's been robbed: the rabbit's gone! Incredibly, Elmer believes him. The dope eventually catches on when Bugs shoves him into the basket and then carries it himself. Somehow Elmer manages to get Bugs home, but the wily rabbit easily escapes. But wait! Why waste a great opportunity? Bugs returns to \"heckle that character.\" He fools Elmer, through a faked radio program, into believing that there's an epidemic of something called \"rabbititus\" going about. Through Bugs's trickery he sees spots, a coat on Bugs's tongue and his own rabbity image reflected at him in a \"mirror\" that's really just Bugs after the glass has been removed. Dr. Killpatient arrives to help, but he has a suspiciously fuzzy tail. Still, it's we in the audience who may prove Bugs's ultimate dupes.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEyMTM0ZjktZmE5NC00ZjEzLWIxYzYtMzc5Y2Y0NmMxMDIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc2NTQzMjU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.9", "imdbVotes": "1,134", "imdbID": "tt0037764", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
