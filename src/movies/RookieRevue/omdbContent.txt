In formation, one private has a great deal of trouble remembering what comes after \"3\"; after he gets it, he decides not to go for the $32 question. In the mess hall, the machine gunners machine gun their food while the bombers catch falling biscuits. The infantry marches for miles - past a \"next time, take the train\" billboard. The camouflage troops march by, invisibly. We see training substitutes: wooden guns, cars marked \"tank\" and, alas, a banner marked \"parachute\" deployed in mid-jump. More training: aerial games (of tic-tac-toe). The anti-aircraft division has target practice, on an aerial shooting gallery. Finally, in an elaborate process, a general provides firing instructions to a big gun; when it hits his own building, he says, \"I'm a baaad general.\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1OTUyM2MtZDNkYy00YzJlLTgxMmMtZTA2ZDFkYmMwYjYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.8", "imdbVotes": "275", "imdbID": "tt0034128", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
