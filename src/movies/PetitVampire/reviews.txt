"_Little Vampire_ is an extraordinary little French animated film that\u2019s amusing and entertaining for both children and adults. You fall in love with all of the characters and the storyline is more riveting than it has any right to be. The film revolves around love and feeling like you\u2019ll be alone forever, but eventually finding that individual that makes you feel less lonely. It\u2019s less about romance and more about having good company for the majority of your existence. You become completely obsessed with the world _Little Vampire_ throws its audience into and you don\u2019t get to spend nearly enough time there. A tale about the undead has never been so funny, charming, and creative.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Fantasia-Little-Vampire-Review""\n"
