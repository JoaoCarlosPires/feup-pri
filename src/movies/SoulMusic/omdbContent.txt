Susan finds herself pressed into taking over Death's \"duty\", but finds that she is falling in love with an elf/human, Imp, who is slowly being taken over by a kind of \"musical\" force that is forcing Imp and his friends to play rock music to the Discworld. The rock music is proving to be a great success, but iit has plans for Imp and everybody wanting to play it, and it is up to Susan, the head of the wizards, the Archchancellor and Death (that is, if he can be found and made to remember who and what he is.) to stop it before it conquers the entire Discworld.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United Kingdom", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzYwMjcwMDk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc5NzkxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.5", "imdbVotes": "1,050", "imdbID": "tt0159914", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "1", "Response": "True"}
