However, his trip never quite gets off the ground mainly because he spends most of it stuck behind a slow moving trailer. When he gets a flat tire, the mechanic inspects every part of his car except the tire. The only motel he can find is a little shack too close to a railroad track. On the road once more, he gets stuck behind said trailer again only to pass it and discover no one is driving it.", "popularity": 2.007, "poster_path": "/4Jbdff3bzb89m4nQLlfPywgiZDv.jpg", "release_date": "1952-10-31", "title": "Two Weeks Vacation", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 15}
