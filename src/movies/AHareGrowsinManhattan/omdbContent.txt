The great Hollywood star tells of his humble beginnings in the tenements of Manhattan. We see poor Bugs terrorized by a gang of canine toughs led by a bullying bulldog who smokes a cigar and wears a derby and a turtleneck sweater. He's subjected to a cruel \"dog pile on the rabbit,\" but our wily Bugs soon turns the tables on these toughs. Bugs subjects his main tormenter to pies in his face; a confusing performance in front of an Egyptian cigarette billboard; a fall from the top of a building; and an embarrassing entanglement in a series of clotheslines. Bugs Bunny finds his real saviors are Betty Smith and a book title calculated to win the heart of any New York bow-wow.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWI0NTVjY2QtZGI3ZC00YThjLTllMDYtMWQ5NmEwYjQ2MzEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc2NTQzMjU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.4", "imdbVotes": "769", "imdbID": "tt0039448", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
