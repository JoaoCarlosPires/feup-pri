Of course, the boy was doing much better before Gabby arrived. In short order, Gabby loses the boy's catch and bait. When Gabby is taunted by a fish, he rents a boat, tackle, and supplies and goes after the fish. Gabby's brief success is cut short when the fish pulls two plugs from the bottom of the boat; with Gabby's hands occupied plugging the holes, the fish raids his lunch box. Time for the secret weapon: a harpoon gun. The fish ties the harpoon line around an old motor, which starts, destroys the boat, and hauls Gabby around like a water-skier. The boy catches him in his net.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE0NWQzMzAtMWEzNy00ODdlLWI0MGUtYjI3NDc3M2FjMmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTM5NDUyMTM@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.9", "imdbVotes": "105", "imdbID": "tt0033643", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
