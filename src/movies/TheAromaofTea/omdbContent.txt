It shows how a small sphere travels in a determined and rhythmical manner through landscapes, emerging at the end into a larger sphere of white light. Both the graphic brushstroke and the music, with its haunting rhythms, are strikingly simple and direct. The theme of the film, a quest followed by a union, is as old as time and recognizable despite its limitless variations.", "Language": "None", "Country": "Netherlands", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJjZjJmYTAtZjBmOC00NjQxLWI0M2ItYjcxOWZlMDdkZjY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA3MjYwMzY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.7", "imdbVotes": "463", "imdbID": "tt1145424", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
