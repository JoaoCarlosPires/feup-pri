{"Title": "Here Comes Dr. Tran", "Year": "2003", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "18 Jul 2003", "Runtime": "8 min", "Genre": "Animation, Short", "Director": "Breehn Burns", "Writer": "Breehn Burns, Jason Johnson", "Actors": "Breehn Burns, Jason Johnson, Cynthia Beckert", "Plot": "I agree, this was a very funny animated which satirizes the media influence on children, complete with the incessant announcer and the innocent Asian child who has no idea what is going on at all. The film is perfect for a good laugh and will (maybe) get you interested in short film animation if you aren't already.-A note to the previous poster, I have a DVD copy of Dr. Tran, but Breehn gave it to me himself so I don't know if they have widely distributed them. When I talked to him last he mentioned something about ownership issues with Spike and Mike so I don't know what is up. Check their website (forget what it is) to see if they'll send you one.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.1", "imdbVotes": "323", "imdbID": "tt0411478", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
