"This was great fun, as Snoopy does the even-more-human-than-dog thing of going through a sophisticated courtship, with hilariously all of the associated trials and tribulations that it holds for us people (including, unfortunately, the risk of being stood up at the altar, as our canine friend has happen here). Certainly not on a par with the vintage material of the classic era for the series, but for one of its 80's shows, definitely very enjoyable.""\n"
