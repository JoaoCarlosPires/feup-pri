"Honestly does explore some pretty engaging concepts, but only very shallowly so. Not as good as your typical episode of the show. Could have either leaned a bit more into the jokes and just been fun, or properly explored the relationships and notions raised, and been kind of compelling. Instead it's neither.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._""\n"
