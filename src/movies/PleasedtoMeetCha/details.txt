They both come in, and whenever Olive isn't looking, they start fighting. She catches them, and tells them one will have to leave. Bluto tells Popey that whoever does the best trick can stay.

Eventually, though, they start destroying her house, and Olive throws them both out, for a little while, anyhow.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/o5QU6INj6GQuAZ57iTnTI8ruefr.jpg", "release_date": "1935-03-21", "title": "Pleased to Meet Cha!", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 2}
