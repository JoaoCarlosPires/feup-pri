"In terms of slide-o-mation (motion comic) as a format, 2011's _Black Panther_ is some of the highest quality you will find. Whether that's saying much or not will depend on your own personal tastes. In either case, it's the story that really matters and on that front, _Black Panther_ is... Okay. It's pretty good honestly, but it could probably have told its story in less time (or told more story in the same time). Nothing on the live action movie we got this year, but I don't exactly think director Jon Schnepp would be offended to hear people having that reaction. \r\n\r\nA must watch for Black Panther fans and Marvel completionists.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._""\n"
