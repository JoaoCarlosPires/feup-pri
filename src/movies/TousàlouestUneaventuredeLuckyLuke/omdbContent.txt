Joe emotionally blackmails Luke to guide them there, hoping to escape on the way. The usual route must shortened from 6 to 2 months, so no danger can be avoided. Given Lucky's reputation, Crook decides to shadow them to add sabotage, just to be sure- or is it?", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "1 win & 1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJiZWNmM2YtMDdkNS00Y2FjLTk3MTYtYmM3YWM0MGIyZmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "1,432", "imdbID": "tt0792992", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
