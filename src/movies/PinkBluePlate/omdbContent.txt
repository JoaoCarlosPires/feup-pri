But the accident-prone panther causes nothing but trouble for the little diner owner. A flipped pizza sticks to the kitchen ceiling, and when the Pink Panther saws a hole through the ceiling and the pizza, with a slab of ceiling wood beneath, falls onto the grill, the little diner owner hurries to bring the pizza to a burly, impatient customer, who bites into a truly wooden-crust pizza, then punishes the little man with a pie in the face. The same customer later requests on two separate occasions a cake and blueberry pie. The Pink Panther catapults the cake into the customer's face, and a fan blows the blueberry topping of the pie to the same unfortunate place. The irate customer puts a R.I.P. wreath at the door of the diner and chases panther and little owner into the horizon.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI3NzY0NzU5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUyNzEzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.2", "imdbVotes": "111", "imdbID": "tt0067578", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
