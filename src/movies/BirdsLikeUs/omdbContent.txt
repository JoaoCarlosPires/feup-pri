Gathered in exuberant daily ritual around the great Egguilibrium mechanism, which is tended by the silent owl, Hasan, they unthinkingly trade their eggs for fruit. Hupu, a beautiful and reckless young bird, is determined to save her egg from this terrible fate and with the help of Hasan, who is her husband, and a magical seed, she opposes Kondor and disrupts the system. In the wild chase that follows Hupu, Hasan, Kondor and a tiny busy-body chick called Mi, find themselves flung out of Birdabad into the jaws of the Horror. Terrified, confused, murderously angry with each other, this ill-assorted band form a reluctant alliance with a most peculiar guide, who promises to help them get home, if they will help him reach the Sun. Only Hupu knows that their guide is blind. Travelling from a vast modern city to the top of a volcano, down the slippery slope of a glacier or across the wide empty sea, always pursued by the Horror, our unlikely heroes cheat, lie, double-cross and abandon each other. Through a series of hilarious and hair-raising adventures, they are eventually forced to work together to face their fear of the Horror and win through to a happy ending that truly takes off.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Qatar", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZlNThmZjctMTg5Yi00OGU0LWI5ZTctYWM2YWRmYWI0YTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.9", "imdbVotes": "156", "imdbID": "tt3837842", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
