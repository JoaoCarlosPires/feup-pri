Dunn", "Actors": "Art Leonardi", "Plot": "The Pink Panther stops to spend a night at a castle in Transylvania, believing it to be a lodge. It is in fact a vampire's castle with such denizens as a hairy, knife-throwing hand, a phantom in squeaky shoes, and the usual living-dead blood-sucker. Thinking the vampire's coffin to be that of a dead man, the Pink Panther buries it. Come dusk, the coffin rumbles to surface, and the vampire emerges. The Pink Panther uses bug spray to repel the vampire in bat form, and it flies out a window and changes to the vampire, who falls into a moat inhabited by a shark. The shark chases the vampire, and the phantom chases the Pink Panther, before sunrise causes vampire, shark, phantom, and castle to disappear.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI3NzY0NzU5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUyNzEzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.7", "imdbVotes": "128", "imdbID": "tt0073548", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
