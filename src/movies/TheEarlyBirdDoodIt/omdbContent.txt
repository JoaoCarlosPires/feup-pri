Every morning, the bird lies in wait to nab the worm, so far without success. To help protect himself, the worm enlists the help of a cat, albeit a somewhat dopey cat. As the bird chases the worm, and as the cat chases the bird, the worm thinks he's got the solution to all his problems, which may sacrifice his new relationship with the cat.
