"**Girl finds out the true identity of her people.**\r\n\r\nOkay, I shocked when I heard this film did not get the Oscars nod, except for a song. Now I have seen the film and I come to know why. This is a one liner, but developed into a longer version Except the initial parts, this film is like a limited cast/character film. Most of the film takes place in the sea sailing around fighting evil force to break the curse. But at the end, you would feel this kind of story is not worth for a feature film. It looks a perfect short animation theme.\r\n\r\nDisney never disappoints its fans, well, for me. So I enjoyed it, it was fun and entertaining, but too simple. The characters were cute, this is a wonderful film for kids and some grownups would too enjoy it. But this is not for all, unlike most of the Disney animations are. Dwayne's voice lending for one of the lead characters was good, but the girl steals the show. Especially if you are a kid and/or a girl.\r\n\r\nThe best film since 'Lilo & Stitch' on the similar theme about Pacific islands' people. But it reminded me 'Whale Rider'. Overall, I think the story should have been improved a bit, in particular by including a few more characters at least for the partial appearances. This is not the best animation of the year, also definitely the bad one to skip. If your purpose of the watch is entertainment/timepass, it is good at that.\r\n\r\n_6\u00bd/10_""\n""After I watched _Zootopia_ in the middle of 2016, I thought to myself \"Well, that does it, this has to be the best Family Movie of the year!\" I was ready to call it right then and there. It wasn't until December rolled around and I got the chance to see _Moana_, that I realised I had spoken far too soon. For in truth Moana deserved that title!\r\n\r\nMostly I'm just happy that I managed to enjoy two whole Disney movies this year.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I strongly recommend you make the time._""\n""Good fun.\r\n\r\nI wasn't expecting <em>'Moana'</em> to be quite so goofy and silly, in that sense the more serious ending doesn't quite fit, but I still felt suitably entertained throughout. The animation is nice, while the music is solid - even if Maui's \"You're Welcome\" is the only memorable song to me.\r\n\r\nDwanye Johnson plays Maui, he is top notch from start-to-finish; obvious casting, but still a welcomed pick. Auli\u02bbi Cravalho (Moana) and Rachel House (Tala) are also up to the mark in their respective roles.\r\n\r\nThought it would be greater, but that doesn't stop the fact that this is an enjoyable film.""\n"
