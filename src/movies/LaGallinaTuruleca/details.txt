Her wiry legs and featherless back don\u2019t startle Isabel, an ex music teacher who picks her for being so special. Turuleca doesn\u2019t lay eggs because her hidden talent is another: she talks, she sings and she dances, giving it her all. Turu, the Wacky Hen is a full-color, animated party that invites us to move our bodies to its musical numbers, making us sing verses that have the power to turn us into children once again, if only for a little while.", "popularity": 13.169, "poster_path": "/xaG10x1C8dCHkNumSslH6jwzvpt.jpg", "release_date": "2019-11-10", "title": "Turu, the Wacky Hen", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 85}
