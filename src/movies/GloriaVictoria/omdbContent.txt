Propelled by the exalting \"invasion\" theme from Shostakovich's Leningrad Symphony (No. 7), the film presents imagery of combat fronts and massacres, leading us from Dresden to Guernica, from the Spanish Civil War to Star Wars. It is at once a symphony that serves the war machine, that stirs the masses, and art that mourns the dead, voices its outrage and calls for peace.", "Language": "None", "Country": "Canada", "Awards": "1 win & 7 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDljMTMyYmMtZTQzZi00Njg2LTk2YjctNWUxNDcyYjY2ZmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1OTY0NjI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "123", "imdbID": "tt3010302", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
