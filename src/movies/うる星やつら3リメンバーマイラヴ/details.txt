With Lum gone, her friends decide that there is no reason to remain, and so Tomobiki slowly returns to normal. The highlight of the film is a high speed chase scene with an angry Lum flying after the mysterious Ruu through the city at night and into a hall of mirrors (and illusion ). Ataru's true feelings for Lum are probably more obvious in this film than any of the others.", "popularity": 12.569, "poster_path": "/91OjQOHE9DM61xwt2TW1DWzEixW.jpg", "release_date": "1985-09-04", "title": "Urusei Yatsura 3: Remember My Love", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 8}
