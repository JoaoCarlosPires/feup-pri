He can't help but crank out the occasional false note, just often enough to enrage his listeners and discourage any donations. He dreams of playing a large pipe organ. The juke box drowns him out at a cocktail bar, a church organ drowns him out on a street, pinball machines drown him out at Luna Park. The city's neon lights and commercial posters overwhelm his small art. At the end of the day, he captures the tear of a calliope horse - his sole earnings for the day - which may prove magical.", "Language": "Dutch", "Country": "Belgium", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzYwNTU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgxNDQzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "84", "imdbID": "tt0262095", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
