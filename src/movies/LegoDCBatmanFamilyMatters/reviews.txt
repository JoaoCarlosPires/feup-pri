"I dunno if you can really just sweep the actual Red Hood story under the rug like that and replace it with... This? I mean I guess you can. They **did** but it seems kind of weird to swap out an arc of torturous death and mysterious resurrection for... Ran away from home. Sure that other stuff is probably to heavy for a LEGO ad targeted at 5 year olds, but you could always just... Adapt a different story. That aside, _Family Matters_ is okay, I suppose. Hated it less than a decent chunk of these things. It had at least some positive aspects, surely.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n"
