Mechano is frighteningly efficient, foiling several attempts by Jerry. Jerry turns this efficiency against him by unleashing several mechanical mice; the zealous robot makes a shambles of the house, and finally itself, in the process of chasing them down. Tom is welcomed back, but at the last moment, a key part of the robot had gone down Tom's throat; Jerry activates it, and sends Tom chasing after one of the wind-up mice.", "popularity": 2.967, "poster_path": "/dYSOipZCEW4LgTht7ZY66bXyrhy.jpg", "release_date": "1952-09-06", "title": "Push-Button Kitty", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 20}
