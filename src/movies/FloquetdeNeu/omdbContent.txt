She's the only white gorilla in the world, and the zoo's main attraction. Children love her, but the other gorillas, Petunia (Jennette McCurdy), Elvis (Nathan Kress), and Anvil (Keith David), don't, because she's different. With the help of an eccentric red panda named Jenga (David Spade), Snowflake plans a secret mission to sneak out of the zoo and venture into the dangerous city to find the witch at the circus who can help her become a \"normal\" gorilla. Will Snowflake find the cure she's looking for, or realize that there's something more important than fitting in, being true to yourself?", "Language": "Catalan, English", "Country": "Spain", "Awards": "1 win & 3 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAzYTA0YzktYjRmYS00Y2VmLWJkZTYtMzhkYjllNmE4ZmZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0ODMzMzM@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "4.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "4.4", "imdbVotes": "653", "imdbID": "tt1429433", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "03 Sep 2013", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
