Film is a very thin or superficial skin, something that covers the human body, but it is also what is under that skin, the whole organism that we cannot see. It is a thin layer of gelatin that coats films, cinema film. From the archives of super 8 films from my family and extracts from the film \"Un chant d'amour\" (1950), by Jean Genet, a body is built marked by memories, by various skins, Nava films, his poems, his landscapes. \"Pel\u00edculas\", his first poetry book, serves as inspiration for this film, which culminates in darkness (\"Volcano\"). Each film, each image, each poem, each landscape leads to a single place, the beach, the sea, the dream, freedom. \"Films\" is a farewell letter from someone who has not met him.", "Language": "Portuguese", "Country": "Portugal", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUwYjIwMjAtNjE5NC00MjVhLTgyMDYtZTg0ODJmMjIyZDdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjYzNzA4OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "N/A", "imdbVotes": "N/A", "imdbID": "tt13322740", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
