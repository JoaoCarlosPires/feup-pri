Meanwhile, the anthropomorphic engine is having trouble on the rails; it has to go up steep hills and pass over missing tracks. It even sprouts hands and arms to pull itself up a hill, but accidentally pulls down the hill's \"pants,\" revealing polka-dotted underpants. In this struggle, the train loses its boxcar. Now Bosko is in distress as the runaway boxcar speeds down the tracks and through tunnels. A cow appears on the tracks; but the pig has been knocked out. Bosko must handle the danger on his own.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzNmJhNTAtYWU4Yi00ZjhlLTk1MmYtZWYyMGY1MjQ2OGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTEyOTA3ODI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.4", "imdbVotes": "159", "imdbID": "tt0020705", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
