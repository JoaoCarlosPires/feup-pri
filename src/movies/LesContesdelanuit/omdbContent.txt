Starting off in Medieval Europe, an unspeakable secret burdens a love-smitten young prince--while at an exotic place in the West Indies--an intrepid adventurer is aided in his quest by an unexpected trio of supporters. Next, the fatalist citizens of the extravagant Aztec City of Gold finally get their Chosen One, as a passionate boy finds his true calling somewhere in a sun-kissed West-African village. Then, a noble Tibetan youth who enjoys the King's trust brings himself to an impossibly painful dilemma--and, lastly--a fervent couple of youthful lovers is torn by a venomous curse. These are the enchanting stories of the night, where everything is possible in the name of love.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France, United States", "Awards": "1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MDgzNTY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjcyMDAxMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.9/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "80%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "66/100"}], "Metascore": "66", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "1,431", "imdbID": "tt1828229", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "29 Jan 2013", "BoxOffice": "$10,975", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
