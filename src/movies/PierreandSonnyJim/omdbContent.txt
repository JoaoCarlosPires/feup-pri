Disguised as ordinary humans, putting effort into blending in with the population while wearing classic short-sleeve casual shirts and sporting dishevelled hairdos very much like Henry Spencer in Eraserhead (1977), unfortunately, the extraterrestrial visitors are in for a shock. And before long, something strange is starting to happen. Aw, what a pity. It turns out that life can be hard on planet Earth, especially when you're running out of air. What have you gotten yourselves into this time, Pierre and Sonny Jim?", "Language": "N/A", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY4NjQzMWUtNDBmMC00NGZjLTk4MmEtNWM5NTBlMWRjZDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk0MDg4NDk@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "3.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "3.7", "imdbVotes": "181", "imdbID": "tt6953854", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
