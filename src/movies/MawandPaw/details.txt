Maw and Paw and their kids live on a farm and can be described as a rural family with below average intelligence (their pet pig, Milford, is regarded in the opening titles as the \"Smart One\"). At dinner, Milford answers a phone-in quiz contest correctly and wins a new car for the family. The problem is no one in the family knows how to drive it (Maw thinks the antenna is a \"new fangled clothesline\").", "popularity": 1.349, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1953-08-09", "title": "Maw and Paw", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
