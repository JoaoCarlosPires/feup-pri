With seven other men, he studies under Lisa: absurd lessons of movement, drawing circles, and servility. He asks for a better room. No other students arrive and none leave for employment. Johannes is unhappy, imperious, and detached from the school's operation. Lisa is beautiful, at first tightly controlled, then on the verge of breakdown. There's a whiff of incest. Jakob is drawn to Lisa, and perhaps she to him. As winter sets in, she becomes catatonic. Things get worse; Johannes notes that all this has happened since Jakob came. Is there any cause and effect?", "Language": "Afrikaans, Spanish, English, German", "Country": "United Kingdom, Japan, Germany", "Awards": "4 wins & 3 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA4OTYxNjQ0NDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDU0MTMyMzg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "100%"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "1,849", "imdbID": "tt0113429", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "24 Jul 2012", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
