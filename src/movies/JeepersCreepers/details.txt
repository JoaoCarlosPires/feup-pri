Before he arrives, we tour the house and hear some evil-sounding cackles, which, it turns out, are coming from a radio one that a ghost was listening to. The ghost then sings the title song while getting ready for a night of haunting, just as Porky arrives. The ghost invites him in with a woman's voice, then disappears. Porky comes in and gets spooked by some flapping curtains. When he comes back in, the ghost puts a couple frogs into a pair of shoes and sets them loose; they collect a hatrack and a curtain, forming a sort of black ghost that ultimately scares Porky upstairs right into the arms of the ghost.", "popularity": 2.853, "poster_path": "/ioJO2MmeyGbO8SefrAYZaADkI95.jpg", "release_date": "1939-09-23", "title": "Jeepers Creepers", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 8}
