"**So she returns, but on the small screen in 2D format.**\r\n\r\nIt was unexpected for the 'Tnagled' fans. I'm one of them. Apart from the short film, they had forgotten about this potential animation franchise. It has been 7 years since the first film and now this television film suddenly made its way. It is an hour long film and a television series is to follow. That news is even more exciting, isn't it. I already saw a couple of episodes and it was equally brilliant. It is good for Disney channel after their top show 'Girl Meets World' concluded, this one is replaced it just like that.\r\n\r\nThis is not a 3D animation, but a product for television in this format is not bad. Because I've seen 3D format TV series and I feel the quality is yet to improve. In fact, the 2D animation was awesome. From the textures to the colours, film characters, backgrounds, it was impressive. Very happy that they have retained almost all the voice-over artists. The original tale means always about the long hair princess. They wanted to keep that way. So that's why this film before the series to commence which reveals an important detail.\r\n\r\nI would say it is a breakthrough for the directors. From this success, I'm anticipating them to involve in a feature 3D animated film for Disney. Despite this triumph, I am hoping for a sequel to the 2010 film, particularly after the first season and before the second to commence to follow from that film. Anyway, this is short and sweet, a film not to be missed by animation fans, especially by Disney fans.\r\n\r\n_7/10_""\n""Not bad for a Disney Channel sequel.\r\n\r\n<em>'Tangled: Before Ever After'</em> is animated in a similar style to <em>'The Lion Guard'</em> (<em>'The Lion King</em> sequel) films. In terms of comparing those two, this 2017 production beats those three follow-ups. It's severely weaker animation, but it does the intended job.\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised to hear the same cast involved from the original film, that's always a big positive. Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Zachary Levi (Flynn) are fine, while the new additions of Eden Espinosa (Cassandra) and Laura Benanti (Lady Caine) aren't noteworthy at all; very average characters in truth.\r\n\r\nI can't hate on this too much though, I'm sure the core target audience will enjoy it and, after all, it is one of Disney better made-for-TV/direct-to-video animated sequels.""\n"
