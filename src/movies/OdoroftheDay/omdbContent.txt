After being thrown out of a traditional doghouse, a bird's nest and even a turtle's shell by their occupants, the dog finds and enters an unoccupied cabin with an open fireplace and cozy bed. But the cabin's owner, an unnamed skunk (who is often mistakenly identified as Pepe Le Pew by cartoon fans) arrives. The two engage in a battle of wits, scents and perfume overkill for occupancy of the cabin and cozy bed. When both come down with colds enabling them to ignore each other's aroma the two decide to peacefully share the bed. As the cartoon ends they simultaneously sneeze, say \"gesundheit\" to each other, then cuddle up and fall asleep.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM1NGM1Y2QtODhkNS00ZDM2LWI0MmMtMGM1NTM5OGNlNzRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0MzU2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "223", "imdbID": "tt0040658", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
