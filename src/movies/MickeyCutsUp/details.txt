When Minnie is captured by a bird's song, Mickey hides in his bird-house and pretends to be a bird himself, until a cat attacks and blows his cover. Then he does a dance while wearing the house; their song attracts more birds, and again the cat. Pluto chases, but he's still pulling the lawnmower, and it causes much destruction.", "popularity": 1.961, "poster_path": "/qozz1nBh79wlWgzeHV1zOZPQzUL.jpg", "release_date": "1931-12-01", "title": "Mickey Cuts Up", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 21}
