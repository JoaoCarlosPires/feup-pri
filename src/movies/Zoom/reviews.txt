Emma as an artist draws a comic book which contains her perfect man. An action film director with big balls and is also a babe magnet. He has no confidence issues until in a fit of pique Emma reduces the size of his manhood.\r\n\r\nThis affects his movie, that of a Brazilian model who has turned novelist.\r\n\r\nEventually all three strands come together as the characters discover that somehow they are all influencing each other leading to a chaotic ending.""\n"
