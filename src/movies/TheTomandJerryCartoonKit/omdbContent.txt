We see them used in two sequences, set against blank backdrops. First, the two have a battle of watermelon seed spitting. When they run out of ammo, Jerry goes back to the box, where there's a book, \"Judo for Mice.\" He studies quickly, and takes on Tom. Tom studies boxing, to no avail. He then studies judo himself and then comes out demonstrating karate-style board/brick breaking, with him and Jerry bringing on ever-larger targets. The last is so large it has to be brought in with a crane, and it crashes through the floor.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, Czechoslovakia", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThlYjgyMzctYTEzMS00ODkxLThkMmYtYWI5MzA3Mzk2Y2IwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxODMyODU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.5", "imdbVotes": "424", "imdbID": "tt0056595", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
