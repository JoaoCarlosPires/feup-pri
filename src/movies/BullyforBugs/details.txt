The bull bucks Bugs out of the arena, prompting the bunny to declare \"Of course you realize, this means war!\" The deft Bugs' arsenal comes plenty packed, as he uses anvils, well-placed face slaps and the bull's horns as a slingshot. The bull fights back, using his horns as a shotgun barrel. The bull's comeback is short-lived; just after Bugs makes out his will, he lures the bull out of the arena, just in time to set up a rube-like device that leads to the bull's defeat.", "popularity": 4.227, "poster_path": "/lqLENKX6DKPyubKrlwhwj0jqYeJ.jpg", "release_date": "1953-08-08", "title": "Bully for Bugs", "video": false, "vote_average": 7, "vote_count": 63}
