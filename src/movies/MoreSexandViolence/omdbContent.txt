In several vignettes, Plympton draws on the essentially comic image of men wearing jackets and ties in a world gone awry. Women, who don't appear all that often, cheerfully participate in the sex and don't hang around for the violence.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE0MjM1NzE0ODleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDM3MjgzMjgx._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.7", "imdbVotes": "185", "imdbID": "tt0177930", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
