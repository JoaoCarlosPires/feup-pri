The boys are going to buy him a box of cigars, but they're broke. They do a quick bout of yardwork and hit Donald up for the price of the cigars (without telling him why), but he makes them put it in a piggy bank.

Donald catches them buying the cigars but thinks they are buying them for themselves and forces them to smoke until they are sick the whole box.", "popularity": 2.472, "poster_path": "/uS6a0CW4XdnxpqZXsRFUrz60HoC.jpg", "release_date": "1949-02-11", "title": "Donald's Happy Birthday", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 16}
