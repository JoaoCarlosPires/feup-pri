"Entertaining movie featuring a character who has become a favorite of my over the past few years, which is why it's a shame there's not going to be a live action version played by Joe Manganiello, so all fans have are these animated movies. This one brought together the tangled history behind a character with some significant flaws and also retains his brutality, which earns this its R rating.\r\n\r\nThis was initially a web series (like Constantine: City of Angels and Vixen) so not sure if there will be a follow-up, and perhaps something to be made an animated film rather than compiled from animated shorts. But good voice casting with Michael Chiklis as Slade/Deathstroke. **3.75/5**""\n"
