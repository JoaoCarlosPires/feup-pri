Meticulous, and with an eye for detail, Sam transforms this mundane but challenging process to a ritual and a true form of art, as the finite space of a suitcase can magically offer so many different combinations, otherwise unseen to the untrained eye. But, it is this unusual knack for taking advantage of the bag's nooks and crannies that binds him with his father, along with the vibrant memories of childhood, and the bittersweet taste of a silent but ardent affection. How much love can one cram in the negative space of recollection?", "Language": "English", "Country": "France", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 10 wins & 7 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0OWNjYzUtZTU5OC00ZWI1LTlhZWEtZDZlYmJmOTkzYzM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.4", "imdbVotes": "2,222", "imdbID": "tt7090150", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
