"\u2018The Secret Life of Pets\u2019 is a weird franchise; I don\u2019t see kids really walking around with Max plushies, nor do I see stories filled with toys from the movie. The original unexpectedly made all this money and so now we have this generic film. There are many, many worse films you could show you children if they like animals - it\u2019s a harmless 90 minutes and its not like their aren\u2019t laughs. I just wish the film was a whole lot more creative.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-secret-life-of-pets-2-crowd-pleasingly-generic-again\r\n\r\nHead to https://www.maketheswitch.com.au/sff for more Sydney Film Festival reviews.""\n"
