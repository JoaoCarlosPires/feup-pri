"Good stuff, unmistakably Tim Burton.\r\n\r\n<em>Frankenweenie</em> is a solid stop-motion horror film from Disney. Interesting plot, coupled with a suitable cast and untypical animation. It's also in black-and-white, which doesn't hamper things at all - I, in a weird sort of way, kinda forgot it was b/w for vast portions.\r\n\r\nCharlie Tahan voices the lead character, Victor Frankenstein. You also have well-known names in Winona Ryder (Elsa), Martin Short (Edward) and Catherine O'Hara (Susan). I also liked Martin Landau as Rzykruski. There's decent humour amongst those characters, too.\r\n\r\nWorth a watch, for sure.""\n"
