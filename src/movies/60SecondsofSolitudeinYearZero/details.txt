A special projector was contructed for the event which allowed the actual filmstrip to be burnt at the same time as the film was shown. When the presentation was finished, the screen itself was burned to the ground with flamethrowers.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/qX3YVD4zkxULeGiD4Ng1WgcAtx8.jpg", "release_date": "2011-12-22", "title": "60 Seconds of Solitude in Year Zero", "video": false, "vote_average": 4, "vote_count": 1}
