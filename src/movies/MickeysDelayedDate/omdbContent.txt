Pluto sees the tickets and races to meet Mickey, but he ends up rolling Mickey in a trash can. This trashes his suit, but it works out, because the dance is a \"hard times\" costume party. And Pluto shows up in the nick of time with the tickets, saving the day.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjA2ZWRiMzctN2ExYS00ZmJmLTllNjYtNDZlYzU4NmZhYjQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.6/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.6", "imdbVotes": "634", "imdbID": "tt0039623", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
