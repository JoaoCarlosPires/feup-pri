"Harmless family film that, as an adult, doesn't have a whole lot to offer. I actually saw this back in 1990 but don't remember what I thought then, course I was only 9 so... Anyway, the animation is fine though the voice acting wasn't great, Tiffany as Judy especially seemed off. Some of the music was also pretty dull and unremarkable. But it's still watchable and thankfully only 82-minutes. **2.5/5**""\n"
