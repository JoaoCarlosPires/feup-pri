The advancement of science allows man to do things he never would have been able to do without, for good or bad. Politicians are either behind the scenes manipulating those scientists or are using that science for their own goals, primarily in the space race. Everyday items and people are projected upwards - many in the form of rockets - followed by iconic structures, such as the Empire State Building, the US Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Eiffel Tower and the Kremlin, being rocketed skyward as visual representations of that race into space.", "popularity": 1.892, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1959-12-31", "title": "Science Friction", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 14}
