Maybe because I am one. This is otaku targeted work par excellence. It contains all of otaku's obsessions and represents the current state of the art of the aesthetic ideals of this social class in contemporary Japanese society. In some ways the animation is not top notch, in others it shows it is not a high budget movie. Overall, though, the art style and the designs are those that tickles the particular receptors of the male Japanese otaku audience the most.It contains the cuteness expected from a Japanese film, specially an animated one, but in a focused, \"maximized cuteness\" in a way that's uncommon. Which I find remarkable if perhaps a bit creepy but also interesting. Other elements of the film, such as the video game inspired plot, reminds me of my teenager years playing RPGs all day and all night.", "Language": "Japanese", "Country": "Japan", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDNiODcyNzQtMzdmYy00NGUyLWI5Y2QtZDkwYmRlMGY1YjhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc4OTQ1OTA@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "50", "imdbID": "tt3833714", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
