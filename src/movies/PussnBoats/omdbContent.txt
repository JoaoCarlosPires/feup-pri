It seductively leads Jerry to its source: a crate full of fromage, queso--cheese! Jerry rashly runs toward the cheese, as it is being pulled onto a cargo ship. But the scent holds out its hand to stop him. Watch out, it's telling him. And then it jerks its thumb toward Tom, the cat who is guarding the ship. Now Jerry is determined to sneak aboard, and Tom is determined to keep him on shore. The captain blithely walks about as this drama unfolds. But a shark off the pier is paying more attention. Either Tom or Jerry would make an excellent meal.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBiMTFkMDQtYTQ3Mi00MmRjLWIyZjQtNzQyZGQ1NjI4OTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxODMyODU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.0", "imdbVotes": "340", "imdbID": "tt0060869", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
