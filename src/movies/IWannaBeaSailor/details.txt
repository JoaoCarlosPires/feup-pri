Mom tells him what a no-account his dad really was, setting sail for Hawaii (\"no, Maw, it was Catalina\") right after the kids were born. Peter is unswayed, and takes off. He turns a barrel into a boat, and crews it with an annoyingly talkative duckling, then sets sail on a lake. They get caught in a thunderstorm (the duck loves it). Peter calls for help and momma comes running, but the duck has already saved him. But he still wants to be a sailor.", "popularity": 1.102, "poster_path": "/gklKbqDmR88lmIex9aI8ziMFUmd.jpg", "release_date": "1937-09-25", "title": "I Wanna Be a Sailor", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 6}
