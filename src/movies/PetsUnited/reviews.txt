"The ending itself was anti-climatic, and there wasn't much background story.\r\nThank you Netflix, for wasting our time with this nonesense!""\n""That was the worst kid's movie I've ever watched, I believe. (Apologies to anyone who worked hard on it!)\r\nWe stopped about two thirds in, and the only reason we kept watching was because my 4 year-old was sufficiently intrigued.\r\nThe jokes were never funny, the flow of the story felt very badly edited, and the contrast between the cute pet story and the evil baddy's motivations was so odd... And then there's the weird choice of accents along with stereotypes (Italian, Russian...). And the characters talking about cosmetic surgery. And the bad rap.\r\nI really recommend not even giving it a try. It's like the \"The Room\" of kids' movies but not as funny.""\n"
