Soon, everyone (except Porky's daughter Little Kitty, who Beans fancies) has rushed out to the mountains, but because Porky takes Beans in his car (!), they get there first. Porky finds a gold nugget, then keeps taking it from his pocket. Beans finds a treasure chest that contains a book, \"How to Find Gold.\" A bad guy spots a sack near Porky's equipment and lassos it; Porky tells Beans that if he retrieves the sack, he can have Porky's daughter. Beans gives chase in Porky's car; there's a shootout. The car runs out of gas, so Beans refills it with moonshine and it takes off like a shot. He snares the bad guy, the sack, and Porky and races back to town. Porky gives Beans his daughter's hand and reveals the contents of the sack.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMjU2NWUtNmU0MC00ODVhLThhMTQtYmM3OWJiYWFiNWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxMzM3NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "420", "imdbID": "tt0026422", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
