Far from home,from work and his boss, far from city traffic and his alarm clock, far from the monotony of his life... The farthest away possible. Travelling against time, visiting places of other centuries. How? Thanks to a magic whistle given him by \"Fairy Sicura\" the most nutty, thoughtless, happy fairy still to be seen around. A golden whistle which can catapult him back into prehistory, or in ancient Rome, in Medieval time, on a desert island, in Fairy tale land, in ancient Egypt, in the far West or in the future.With whom? He travels with Gastone, his boss'dog, tiny,naive and a little bit spoiled : after many adventures he will realize how much more valuable a friend is rather than a cream pie. Will he find it? Yes, but not in the past, not in other centuries, full of incredible and miserable adventures for him. Happiness was much closer,at hand's reach. He only had to think about it... Isnt that right, Mr Rossi?", "popularity": 0.805, "poster_path": "/1RmvqPSHJ0G34vCK4NguVFx7uLK.jpg", "release_date": "1976-03-04", "title": "Mr. Rossi Looks for Happiness", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.3, "vote_count": 6}
