The druggist mixes a potion and falls asleep. The skull-and-crossbones on the bottle comes to life and drips the potion on the druggist, shrinking him. The baby bottle start crying (in three-part harmony). The druggist lights a lantern, then plays a perfume atomizer like bagpipes, bringing a bottle of Scotch Whiskey to life. Other bottles that come alive include smelling salts, bath salts, Listerine, perfume, india ink (doing a snake charmer bit with some Cobra toothpaste). A Dutch boy and girl go figure skating on a mirror, with help from some talcum-powder snow. The druggist wraps a pipe around himself and plays it as a tuba. The skull and crossbones hatch a nefarious scheme, helped by the witch hazel and spirits of ammonia ghosts. He gets sent through distilling apparatus and is otherwise mangled and then he wakes up.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZmM2Q5YTUtNmQ3Yi00OWI2LThmNWEtNjRkMTQxNDU3NzE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzYzNzUzMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "233", "imdbID": "tt0027390", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
