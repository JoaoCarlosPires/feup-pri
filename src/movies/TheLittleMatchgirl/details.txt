It's winter, and the hustling crowds at best ignore her, and some are outright rude. She takes shelter and, to try to stave off the cold a bit, lights a match. It gets blown out; this happens again, then on the third try, she falls into a dream. In this dream, cherubs attend her, she gets a new doll, then a new dress. The cherubs put her on a throne. Then a storm comes, and she goes toward a candle. That candle goes out, and we see that back in the real world, so did her match and her life. An angel comes along and takes her soul.", "popularity": 1.231, "poster_path": "/lHke1VmCu2s1HGk95Ajn20ohkUi.jpg", "release_date": "1937-11-05", "title": "The Little Match Girl", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9}
