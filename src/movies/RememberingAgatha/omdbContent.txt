Haunted by the Black Madonna, while being encouraged by her carefree friend Cynthia to somehow liberate herself, Agatha feels trapped, unable to transform her life. One night, she finds a portal through the dishwasher into the forest of her childhood. In this world, her child-self reminds Agatha of forgotten joy and innocence.
