The stupidest of the dogs, whose objective is to cut a fox's tail off, becomes his main victim; Bugs tricks him into chasing a train instead. He eventually tricks the dog pack into running off a cliff, but the stupid dog ends up with Bugs' tail.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/pxtU0kmOGT1E9HudercFtpB7j3n.jpg", "release_date": "1952-02-22", "title": "Foxy by Proxy", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 7}
