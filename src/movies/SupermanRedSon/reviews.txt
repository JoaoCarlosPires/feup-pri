"A pretty underwhelming film adaptation of one of DC's best arcs. The original Superman story it's based on is **so** good, that this still comes away being okay by association, but it's still very disappointing compared to the source material, and isolated to itself is still an only okay sit down with the Big Red Boy Scout. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._""\n""Okay DC animated movie, a little heavy-handed and features some bad dialogue, but I did like the voice acting from Jason Isaacs as Superman and pretty good animation as well. Nothing I'd watch again but maybe worth a rental. **3/5**""\n"
