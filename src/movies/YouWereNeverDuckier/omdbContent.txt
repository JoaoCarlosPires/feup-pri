Daffy disguises himself as a rooster and decides to enter. However, he attracts the attention not of the judges but of Henery Hawk and his father, George K. Chickenhawk. It isn't long before the faux rooster is abducted by the hungry chickenhawks, and Daffy pleads fruitlessly that he is, in fact, NOT a rooster but a duck. Daffy then realizes the contest is about to start, makes a hasty retreat to the auditorium and loses both the $5,000 prize and a $5 prize (for the best duck) to his predators (who are both disguised appropriately, young Henery pretending to be a duck and quacking happily at his small prize).", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGE3YTA0ZGMtMGI1NC00NTEyLWE2NmUtYmUzMGZkYWIwMTIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.5", "imdbVotes": "502", "imdbID": "tt0040984", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
