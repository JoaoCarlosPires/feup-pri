All sorts of sports and activities, familial, lonesome, adult or childish come into focus in this unique experimental short, but in an unexpected way: the image is distorted, by what at the beginning seems either digital means or multi-prismatic lens, yet is more likely to be a sheet of metal with slight bumps. And if this seems to either take all the magic of the image or an insistence on a secondary matter, yet figuring out this aspect of the image, its puzzling materiality is part of the game and the pleasure. I reveled in some abstract tableaux, almost still or in motion, evoking the grand traditions of painting, and ranging from the texture inside the head from Magritte's \"The Secret Double\", to a cubism in motion after Picasso's \"Les Demoiselles d' Avignon\". The bouncing soundtrack was fitting and quite evoking.
