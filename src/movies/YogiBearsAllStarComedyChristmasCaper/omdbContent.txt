Boo Boo and I left Jellystone Park to spend the most wonderful time of the year metropolitan-style, with friends Snagglepuss, Quick Draw McGraw and the gang! Luckily, I outwitted Ranger Smith with my department store Santa disguise. Our adventure led me to Judy, a girl who wants to spend more time with her workaholic dad. Who knew my love of pic-a-nic baskets would reunite them at a big city Christmas picnic in the park? Join the merrymaking, but get here before the basket is empty! The Flintstones, Huckleberry Hound, Auggie Doggie, and more friends also join us, making this Christmas caper full of our favorites. -- Yours Truly, Yogi Bear", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk4ZmY2YzktNWRkZi00ODYxLTlkYTAtYzdjYzJkNzM5MTNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODc2MzUyNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "192", "imdbID": "tt1205608", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
