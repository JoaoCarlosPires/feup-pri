He learns from his dim-witted best friend, Cody, a porcupine and street-con, that while he was in lock-up, the entire forest was picked clean by The A.C.O.R.N.S. Institute (Alternative Cosmetic Oils for Regenerative Natural Skin-care). No acorn was left behind. With winter just around the corner, it's a potentially devastating blow to all forest critters. So, Frankie has no choice but to bust into the brand new, state-of-the-art, rodent-proof A.C.O.R.N.S. Processing Plant and take back all of the acorns! Though a seemingly impossible heist, success would not only save the lives of his forest friends, but it would also give Frankie a chance to win back the love of his life, Lola, a local \"show squirrel.\" Sadly, Lola has been burnt by too many of Frankie's false promises in the past.", "popularity": 1.576, "poster_path": "/hFQesQpPToxfn8jyWuNQ5s8Y1FW.jpg", "release_date": "2015-03-01", "title": "Get Squirrely", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 10}
