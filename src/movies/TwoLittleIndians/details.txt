Trouble is, the orphans, dressed as Indians, want to shoot arrows and tomahawk-chop everything in sight, and especially Tom, who quickly gets scalped and has the end of his tail chopped off. He captures Jerry; this, of course, means war, for which the tots paint dozens of badminton shuttlecocks as a fake army. They also paint a fierce face on the sleeping dog. Ultimately, they get Tom to leave a trail of gunpowder, which they light, destroying the garage. Tom signals a truce, and they all smoke a peace pipe, but the smoke comes out of Tom's ears instead of his mouth.", "popularity": 1.033, "poster_path": "/jO2fwReWw9eTUdl7iESrPvLfpiM.jpg", "release_date": "1953-10-17", "title": "Two Little Indians", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 23}
