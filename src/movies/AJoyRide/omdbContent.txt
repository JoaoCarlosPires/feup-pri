This cartoon series is based on his \"Judge Rummy\" series, a funny animals strip that portrayed its title character as a literal boozehound.It's direction by Grim Natwick gives it the sort of plot that might make sense to someone on a binge. The judge and his buddy take a rowboat to one of the ships that lay just outside the five-mile limit to cater to people who wished to drink and gamble. The animation is good, but the cartoon is mildly incoherent, rendering it only mildly interesting.", "Language": "None", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMxZDVmNGQtYzlkNy00NjdjLWJjYTctYzljYzc4ZTZmOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ1NjM2MDg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "4.6/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "4.6", "imdbVotes": "11", "imdbID": "tt0959473", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
