Mickey throws Pluto's ball into the jungle, and he chases it but it looks exactly the same as an armadillo that's rolled up into a ball. This, of course, greatly confuses Pluto for a while. But he eventually makes friends with the armadillo. He chases the critter into a cave right behind his ball, and rips the ball apart thinking it's the armadillo, which makes him very sad until the armadillo shows up again.", "popularity": 1.999, "poster_path": "/gNSa6Oul3Bo1XsQZ0T8o5dIlaDO.jpg", "release_date": "1943-02-19", "title": "Pluto and the Armadillo", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 13}
