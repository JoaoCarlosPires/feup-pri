The game is not going well for the Tea Totallers, as the Gorillas, a bunch of oversized, roughneck players, are not only dominating the Tea Totallers, made up of old men, but intimidating the umpire by knocking him into the ground like a tent peg after an unpopular judgment. The Gorillas' home runs go screaming out of the ballpark (literally) and the batters form a conga line, with each hitter knocking a ball out.", "popularity": 4.378, "poster_path": "/6sVUeSueyiS7Rh36LApVeIaiAL2.jpg", "release_date": "1946-02-02", "title": "Baseball Bugs", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 44}
