The royal grounds are, in fact, amply posted with \"No Poaching\" signs (one sign reads \"Not even an egg\"), but Bugs either didn't see or ignored them. Of course, Bugs sets out to endlessly turn the tables on the hapless Sheriff, at one point talking him into building a six-room Tudor home in the middle of the King's gardens. The dueling pair are periodically interrupted by a chubby Little John who proclaims, each time he appears, \"Don't you worry never fear, Robin Hood will soon be here\". In the end, the merriest of merry men does appear and it's...it's...oh, see it yourself. Bugs goes in disguise as the King, who then knights the Sheriff (\"Arise, Sir Loin of Beef...\").", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk5MGFjYjAtNTEwMC00NGNlLTgxOTgtZDRkMDZmMDc4YjUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.8", "imdbVotes": "1,616", "imdbID": "tt0041779", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
