{"Title": "Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha: Detonation", "Year": "2018", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "19 Oct 2018", "Runtime": "111 min", "Genre": "Animation, Action", "Director": "Takayuki Hamana", "Writer": "Maki Tsuzuki", "Actors": "N/A", "Plot": "Imagine if you had something like The Avengers movies but removing all the inconsistencies such as picking up characters from very different fictional worlds, instead, you had a consistent integrated story that made perfect sense inside its universe of magic and technology. In fact, the use of terms such as nanotechnology in fiction is just another way of saying magic and this movie expresses this idea very well.In terms of plot this movie is the second part of the story that began in Reflection. Every mystery of the first movie is explained and made clear. Torwards the end it gets very emotional, overall, I almost cried watching some scenes.Yes, it has some issues, mostly relating to its very conventional direction and the transformation sequences go too long for their own good. Howerver, I am not cutting points for this because the movie never tried to be something experimental and indulgence in transformation sequences is Nanoha's franchise defining characteristic.", "Language": "Japanese", "Country": "Japan", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU5ZWFkZDQtOGZkMC00NTI2LWI2Y2ItNTdmMTkzY2U0MjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzEyMDQ1MDA@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "26", "imdbID": "tt9164818", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
