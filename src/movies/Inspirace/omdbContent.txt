He draws inspiration from the rain, and raindrops become locations for vivid images from his imagination. The character Colombine from commedia dell'arte appears, and then dances alone. Her lover Pierrot joins the scene and attempts to get her attention, but Colombine spurns him. Later, Colombine rides alone in a horse-drawn carriage. Pierrot hitch-hikes for a ride, but is brokenhearted when she ignores him. The vivid images end when the candle in the artist's room dies down. As the artists struggles to light it again and get back to work, the film ends.", "Language": "Czech", "Country": "Czechoslovakia", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNjZjA0N2ItNWRiYy00MmY3LWFiNWItYmViMjMxMjE1OGZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzA5MDQ3MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.5", "imdbVotes": "460", "imdbID": "tt0041510", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
