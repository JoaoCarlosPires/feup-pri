He falls through a trapdoor (on the second floor) and is soon rising to the orchestra conductor's podium on the first floor and is even sooner conducting the orchestra in a presentation of Faust (but somebody is singing about Figaro). Lots of sight gags, voice-caricatures, racial stereotypes, and the usual allotment of risqu\u00e9 moments in a Pre-Code cartoon.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JmYzAyOTgtYTM4NS00M2RhLWFhNjMtMWE4YWM5OGMzMzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDU4MTQ0Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.1", "imdbVotes": "112", "imdbID": "tt0147123", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
