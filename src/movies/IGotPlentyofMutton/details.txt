However, if he had read the rest of the article first, he would have known that the flock is now guarded by the ram, \"Killer Diller,\" a formidable foe. When the straightforward approach doesn't work, the wolf dresses as an attractive lady sheep, which immediately lures the amorous ram. The hapless wolf's attempt to club the ram, however, fails when he whacks an overhanging branch instead. He escapes, to another tree that conveniently has a safe hanging in it; it drops on the ram, but he emerges unscathed. Next is an anti-aircraft gun, but the ram hauls the disguised wolf inside. The panicked wolf runs for hours, finally tearing off his disguise in desperation \"I'm a wolf!\" \"So am I!\"", "popularity": 1.402, "poster_path": "/vI1MgCTy8f7ZZM81lhEUnKu8BHD.jpg", "release_date": "1944-03-11", "title": "I Got Plenty of Mutton", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 5}
