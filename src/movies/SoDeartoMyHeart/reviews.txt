"Not far off being a good film, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n<em>'So Dear to My Heart'</em> does do bits well, there are a few amusing moments and some sweet ones. The cast are pleasant enough, if nothing standout. A couple of parts are a little slow, while it has the usual animal questionability to it that a lot of films tend to have from this era.\r\n\r\nAll in all, an alright watch but one that's just short of being something I'd recommend. It's nothing bad, I will say that.\r\n\r\n/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\\""\n"
