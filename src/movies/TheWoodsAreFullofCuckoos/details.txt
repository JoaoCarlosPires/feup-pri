The MC is bandleader Ben Birdie, heckled by Walter Finchell. Wendell Howell prepares to lead a singalong; he gives several different page numbers in the songbook, then says, \"Never mind, we won't use the books.\" The audience, responding \"Oh yes we will\" pelts him. Billy Goat and Ernie Bear introduce and sing the title song. Everyone sings along, except a fox, who informed he's singing the wrong song, responds, \"Why don't somebody tell me these things?\" We pan across a series of celebrity guests, like W.C. Field-mouse, Dick Fowl, Deanna Terrapin, Bing Crowsby, and the high-note competing duo of Grace Moose and Lily Swans. Tizzie Fish has a cooking segment. Finally, Louella Possums introduces a company performing a scene from The Prodigal's Return.", "popularity": 2.097, "poster_path": "/aRF4d4hFnbLZzHL4qbtnbOGhCCM.jpg", "release_date": "1937-12-03", "title": "The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.9, "vote_count": 11}
