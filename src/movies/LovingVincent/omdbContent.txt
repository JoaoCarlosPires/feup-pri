Although disdainful of this seemingly pointless chore, Armand travels to Auvers-sur-Oise where a purported close companion to Vincent, Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn), lives. Having to wait until the doctor returns from business, Armand meets many of the people of that village who not only knew Vincent, but were apparently also models and inspirations for his art. In doing so, Armand becomes increasingly fascinated in the psyche and fate of van Gogh as numerous suspicious details fail to add up. However, as Armand digs further, he comes to realize that Vincent's troubled life is as much a matter of interpretation as his paintings, and there are no easy answers for a man whose work and tragedy would only be truly appreciated in the future.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Poland, United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, Netherlands", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 23 wins & 53 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjE2NjgwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYzMzEwMzI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.8/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "84%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "62/100"}], "Metascore": "62", "imdbRating": "7.8", "imdbVotes": "54,515", "imdbID": "tt3262342", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "16 Jan 2018", "BoxOffice": "$6,735,118", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
