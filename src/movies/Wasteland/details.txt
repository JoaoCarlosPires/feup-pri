Something integral to the point of this overall series is visualizing and externalizing different characters' worldviews through what visual medium is being used and how their view of the world is presented, & establishing an internal visual and aural vernacular inside the series of films that make certain subtle aspects make sense to people who are paying attention. The 5 different parts can all be viewed individually and are meant to make sense on their own, but when viewed together and in sequence bring a different and more interesting context to each of the pieces.", "popularity": 1.609, "poster_path": "/4OZf3gNeifQTeQbqTKtu4asRws3.jpg", "release_date": "2019-06-04", "title": "Wasteland", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.3, "vote_count": 2}
