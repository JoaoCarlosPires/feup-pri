"This isn't exactly **peak** ZIM, but it is definitely ZIM. By that, I guess I mean, the television show at its best moments was better than this movie was overall, but this movie overall still absolutely remained faithful to the television show. Within minutes I felt transported back to my youth, watching the ZIM series as a teenager. It's not my favourite part of the franchise, but it 100% captures the spirit of why I loved it to begin with. This may cause a whole new generation of kids to get railed on for thinking GIR is fun, but maybe if we could just let people enjoy things this time around that might be nice.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._""\n"
