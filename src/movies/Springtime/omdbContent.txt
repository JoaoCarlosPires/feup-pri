In this one, Farmer Al Falfa and Henry the Cat go down to beach, where Al is singularly unsuccessful in impressing the pretty young ladies.At my age, I feel for him. However, for reasons that are not so clear, he also gets attacked by a monkey who has lost his mate -- presumably she ran off with another monkey who resembles Al.Although the gags are not terribly funny, being purely of the \"someone else is in pain\" variety, they will doubtless appeal to a lot of people. In addition, Terry is still playing with adult themes here. The result is not to my taste, but good.", "Language": "None", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIyNmIyYWEtZWZhZS00MDUwLWEyYmUtMzA4NmYxMDcwOGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDY3OTcyOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.6/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.6", "imdbVotes": "61", "imdbID": "tt0403532", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
