Having identified Darwin as a world that could support life, Earth sends a pilot mission consisting of the Mothership Von Braun and three probes: Balboa, Da Vinci, and Newton. This robotic fleet is responsible for finding and assessing any life forms on Darwin IV. Initially, the expectation is to find microscopic life, but the probes soon find themselves in the middle of a developed ecosystem teeming with diversity of life of all sizes. The drama on Darwin IV is motivated by real science missions, such as the NASA Origins Program and the NASA / JPL Planet-Finder Mission, as well as the European Space Agency's Darwin Project. \"Alien Planet \" is a cosmic expedition along side Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Jack Horner, Craig Venter, and George Lucas, and NASA's Chief Scientist Jim Garvin. No longer just the domain of science fiction, \"Alien Planet\" dramatizes an exciting and possible answer to what alien life really looks like and when we'll find it.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE4OWI2MGUtNzkxNy00NmI5LTllMTEtODAxZDQ1Y2RjY2ZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjcwMzExMzU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "1,492", "imdbID": "tt0453446", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
