The only law left is Ragnarok, a hard-hitting enforcer and his alien friend Smith, who travel the Universe in an attempt to see fair play.", "popularity": 1.504, "poster_path": "/gUwMN1z0DOrtU5qJVgHpfJ9Az5X.jpg", "release_date": "1983-03-01", "title": "Ragnarok", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
