"Rough watch, probably won't watch again, and can't confidently recommend, unless it's for younger audiences...and even then, probably no.\r\n\r\nThis movie feels like a first attempt.  Tad is actually a charming underdog character, Sarah plays well as an attraction for the lead and an independently grown character which shows so much intricacy from a writing perspective that the rest of the non-animal characters are baffling.\r\n\r\nThere is just so little here to work with that I don't have a lot to say.  The train action sequence was actually decent, but I was wasn't engaged with the movie for the majority of the time.\r\n\r\nI think this is better skipped, but if you actually like this, then there is a sequel that is slightly better.""\n"
