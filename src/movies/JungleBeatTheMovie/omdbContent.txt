One morning, the animals of the jungle wake up to discover that they can speak. They're even more amazed when they learn the reason why: There's an alien in the jungle. Little FNEEP has come to conquer the planet and has brought some crazy tech with him, including a translation device that lets them talk for the first time. Unfortunately for the intergalactic Scaldronian empire, but fortunately for the jungle, Fneep is a terrible conqueror: He's homesick, he's crashed his ship, and he's no match for the antics of MUNKI, TRUNK and the gang. Our heroes won't let a little alien conquest get in the way of a good time or a new friend. As the animals help him on his journey home, he learns that friendship could be the greatest force in the universe.
