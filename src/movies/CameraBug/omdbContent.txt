{"Title": "Camera Bug", "Year": "1972", "Rated": "G", "Released": "06 Aug 1972", "Runtime": "6 min", "Genre": "Animation, Short", "Director": "Arthur Davis", "Writer": "John W. Dunn", "Actors": "Larry D. Mann, Tom Holland", "Plot": "In the copy I saw of this cartoon on the Cartoon Research site, the snake was mostly the color of Silly Putty. In all probability, the print had faded in that mildly disgusting manner that the chemical dyes used in then-current color film did. Earlier Technicolor prints did not fade; the dyes used for Technicolor were derived from plants, much more stable. If you can find a print from 1950 that isn't battered from repeated showings, it is beautiful. Cartoons from a quarter century later are ugly.In many ways that's a metaphor for what happened to cartoons. This cartoon is one of a series produced to fill out a contract with United Artists. I never saw one in a movie theater. It was a job for the people involved, something intended to put some money in the pockets of people Friz Freleng had worked with for decades. The story is about the Blue Racer in Japan, and his interactions with a picture-taking insect in Japan. The insect speaks like Benny Rubin doing Joe Jitsu on the Dick Tracy Show. It's dull, it's sad and you can skip this one.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.1", "imdbVotes": "9", "imdbID": "tt0147950", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
