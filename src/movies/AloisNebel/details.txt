The end of the eighties in the twentieth century. Alois Nebel works as a dis\u00adpatcher at the small railway station in B\u00edl\u00fd Potok, a remote village on the Czech\u2013Polish border. He's a loner, who prefers old timetables to people, and he finds the loneliness of the station tranquil \u2013 except when the fog rolls in. Then he hallucinates, sees trains from the last hundred years pass through the station. They bring ghosts and shadows from the dark past of Central Eu\u00adrope. Alois can\u2019t get rid of these nightmares and eventually ends up in sanatorium.  In the sanatorium, he gets to know The Mute, a man carrying an old photograph who was arrested by the police after crossing the border. No one knows why he came to B\u00edl\u00fd Potok or who he\u2019s looking for, but it is his past that propels Alois on his journey\u2026", "popularity": 2.337, "poster_path": "/G2WxodRC1RrK411bWOt5Q7tYqq.jpg", "release_date": "2011-09-04", "title": "Alois Nebel", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 24}
