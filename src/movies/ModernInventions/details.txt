After getting in without paying, he meets a robot butler who takes Donald's hat every time he sees him. Donald is very annoyed by this and magically fixes himself a new hat every time this happens and strolls on. Ignoring the sign not to touch it, Donald starts playing with a wrapping machine and ends up being wrapped himself. He also encounters and tries out a robot nursemaid and a fully automatic barber chair. They both don't do him much good.", "popularity": 3.055, "poster_path": "/dRuCC4yAgIGRjsTz8evhNsCXM3d.jpg", "release_date": "1937-05-29", "title": "Modern Inventions", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 42}
