He tries a new drawing, and this time he produces Bosko, a caricatured Negro boy with a simple, rounded design. Once finished, Bosko becomes animate on the paper. \"Well, here I is,\" he declares to the mildly surprised cartoonist. \"And I shore feel good!\" Bosko proceeds to dance, play the piano--and sing. But his singing is so bad that the cartoonist sucks Bosko back into his ink pen and then pours him into his inkwell. But the end of this demo reel proves that Bosko can't be beaten so easily.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE0MDdkNzAtNTIxZC00ZGI3LTk4YWItYWIzNTY1OGIwMGQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDcwNDI2MTk@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.6/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.6", "imdbVotes": "489", "imdbID": "tt0019714", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
