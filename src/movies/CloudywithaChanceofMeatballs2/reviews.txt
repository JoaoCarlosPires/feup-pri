"Much more effort involved than your typical \"animated kid's movie sequel made in the 21st century\". The story might not be quite as straightforward as the first _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_, but it ups the fantastical quality, making me appreciate it even more. Such a great hangover film.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._""\n""Decent watch at best, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend except for younger audiences (possibly with bad taste in humor).\r\n\r\nEvery line in this movie is awful.  I'll admit that I got pulled in a couple of times just because we went from horrible to average only to have it punchline in awful again.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, when I say \"awful\" it is a just a lot of bad, cringey humor.  But it really is like, \"okay, they gave us a sequel, but there is NO WAY we're getting a 3rd, let's go ham.\"\r\n\r\nI wasn't a big fan of the first one, and creating sentient food is cute, but weirdly problematic from a biological or large-scale morality standpoint.\r\n\r\nUltimately the concept of a \"potatopotomus\" is cute and slightly amusing, but quickly loses steam as part of a story.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to get in a helicopter and get far enough away from everything, there is actually a good story structure there, but just the worst execution.""\n""Trying to follow what is happening in this movie is just not gonna happen, but the visuals are so bright and fun I don't think anyone will care.""\n"
