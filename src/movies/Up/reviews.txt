"A fun and charming adventure.\r\n\r\n<em>'Up'</em> certainly knows how to tug at the heartstrings. It creates a very meaningful story around Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), with the early scenes particularly standing out as superb.\r\n\r\nI don't overly enjoy the parts with Dug (Bob Peterson) and Kevin (Pete Docter), not that they are bad, though everything with Fredricksen, Russell (Jordan Nagai) and Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer) is entertaining and/or hearty.\r\n\r\nAsner and Nagai do terrific, in what is one of Disney's 'best of the rest' films. There is some lovely music by Michael Giacchino, too. Go watch!""\n""To Christopher Plummer and Ed Asner...\r\n\r\nRIP.""\n"
