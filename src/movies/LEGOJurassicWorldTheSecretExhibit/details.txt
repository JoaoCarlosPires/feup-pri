It's the greatest thing since the discovery of dinosaurs, but in order for it to succeed, he needs his right-hand, can-do problem solver, Claire Dearing, to get a trio of dinosaurs across the park to the new, super-secret exhibit. Reluctantly teaming up with newcomer Owen Grady, the animal behaviorist she hired sight unseen to deliver the dinosaurs, the duo sets out on a fun-filled adventure across the island. Unfortunately, delivering the dinosaurs to the new attraction is not as easy as they thought.", "popularity": 14.418, "poster_path": "/v0hr8LOIpsobvVm7FogxaIg7gLx.jpg", "release_date": "2018-11-25", "title": "LEGO Jurassic World: The Secret Exhibit", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 31}
