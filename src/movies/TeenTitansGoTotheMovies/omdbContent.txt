But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick. If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them. With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream. But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously super villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry. The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "9 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZhMTIwZDUtYjZjZS00MmViLTg3NzEtNWE5NzI1NDUwNDJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODQxMTI4MjM@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.8/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "91%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "69/100"}], "Metascore": "69", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "18,111", "imdbID": "tt7424200", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "30 Oct 2018", "BoxOffice": "$29,790,236", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
