"Decent watch at best, won't watch again, and can't recommend.\r\n\r\nI didn't really appreciate the cg styling and the reduction of the princess characters.  Even the exaggerated portrayal of the prince through his curse wasn't terribly interesting, and it didn't come into play all that much as the main story is to get away from an area where it would be relevant with someone who is immune.\r\n\r\nThere just isn't a lot interesting that is intended to be so other than the \"gauntlet\" itself and even that is only mildly interesting.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of hidden messages about women and men, equality, and bias, and if I wasn't so bored, then I probably wouldn't have noticed.""\n"
