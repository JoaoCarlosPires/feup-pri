Various animal residents throw things at him, trying to stop the singing, until he is buried. He pokes his head up, and a lump from his head becomes the bouncing ball, over a field of concentric hearts. The now-crying dog drags a rock tied to a cord around his waist, as he writes a suicide note. Sal, in a hat with a flower, dances over the lyrics, morphing until she is nude, except for a grass skirt. Dancing under the palms, she is stopped by the police department.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "4.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "4.4", "imdbVotes": "20", "imdbID": "tt0141631", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
