The bureaucratic coolness (or lack of humour) in his voice actually was the funniest part of all. The rest of the film was made up of childish and very predictable (thus non-funny) jokes. The story seemed to be made for a pre-teen audience and thereby failed to address those who still know the real Derrick and Harry Klein. Further, the constant repetition of the same jokes, in particular the denunciation of modern show business, got annoying and attested a lack of real ideas. Besides the poor contents, the quality of the drawings was merely mediocre. Again only Derrick stood out for a slightly more felicitous portraiture. I recommend to wait for the TV release.", "Language": "German", "Country": "Germany, Ireland, Taiwan", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhMDY2ZTYtNmQ5Ny00OTRjLWI0ODctM2VkYWFjYzQ3YWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzMzMjU5NDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "4.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "4.0", "imdbVotes": "252", "imdbID": "tt0387162", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
