"Enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI occasionally watched the television series when I was younger and remember liking it, so I guess it's no surprise that I had a good time with <em>'Recess: School\u2019s Out'</em>.\r\n\r\nIt features a pretty ridiculous plot but it's brought to life well by the characters and animation. All the former are good, each one with differing personalities. None of the voice cast standout majorly but they all fit perfectly and work together nicely. I rate the music used, also.\r\n\r\nA simple yet effective film, one that you'll rate if you find the TV episodes entertaining.""\n"
