Little does Natsumi know that the statue houses Ongo, a terrible monster bent on world conquest. In a dream, a strange old man named Ahem warns Natsumi of Ongo's return, and gives her a necklace and tells her to do a sexually suggestive dance that will protect her from peril. Once Natsumi awakens, she finds Ongo on her bed...who's not too threatening looking. But now whenever danger rears it's ugly head, Natsumi must swallow her modesty, and do the embarrassing dance to transform into Mii, the large breasted flower spirit of New Guinea's past.", "popularity": 2.579, "poster_path": "/sL2UGVEH5YAcMN0czWeGHISnHQ8.jpg", "release_date": "1997-03-26", "title": "Jungle de Ikou!", "video": false, "vote_average": 7, "vote_count": 5}
