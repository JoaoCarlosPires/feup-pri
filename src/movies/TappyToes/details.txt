But that s not the only thing that makes Pingo unique. He also happens to be raised by a most unlikely duo, Lou and Buddy, two birds of prey who initially set out to make a meal out of Pingo and end up taking him in as their own. Pingos toe tapping skills not only catch the eye of a darling young female penguin, Bella, but they could be the key to stopping the vile hermit crab, Gabby, and his dimwitted sea lion sidekick, Thrasher, from destroying a colony of penguins that are home to Pingos long lost parents.", "popularity": 1.46, "poster_path": "/8L4hZUkAbLvV47dwKsQim8XTjaR.jpg", "release_date": "2011-11-01", "title": "Tappy Toes", "video": false, "vote_average": 2, "vote_count": 1}
