No big deal, right? It all starts when creative outsider Katie Mitchell is accepted into the film school of her dreams and is eager to leave home and find \"her people,\" when her nature-loving dad insists on having the whole family drive her to school and bond during one last totally-not-awkward-or-forced road trip. But just when the trip can't get any worse, the family suddenly finds itself in the middle of the robot uprising. Everything from smart phones, to roombas, to evil Furbys are employed to capture every human on the planet. Now it's up to the Mitchells, including upbeat mom Linda, quirky little brother Aaron, their squishy pug, Monchi, and two friendly, but simple-minded robots to save humanity.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, Canada, Hong Kong", "Awards": "1 win & 2 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjdkZjNjNDItYzc4MC00NTkxLTk1MWEtY2UyZjY5MjUwNDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA1OTcyNDQ4._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.7/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "98%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "80/100"}], "Metascore": "80", "imdbRating": "7.7", "imdbVotes": "77,443", "imdbID": "tt7979580", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "30 Apr 2021", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
