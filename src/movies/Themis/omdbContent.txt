Against a background that is blue or pink - or sometimes briefly yellow or orange - geometric shapes appear and move: a sphere, a square, clear shafts shaped like pencils, rectangles. As colors change, the shapes move, spin, and rest. Sometimes, the change of colors reflects the shapes bumping into each other. Tableaus appear like Braque paintings.", "Language": "N/A", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.9", "imdbVotes": "164", "imdbID": "tt0310221", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
