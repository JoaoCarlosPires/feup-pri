"I have no idea who this _Teen Titans_ movie is for. New comers will be absent any indication of who the characters are or what's going on, and old hats will have seen this all take place 47 bloody times before...\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n"
