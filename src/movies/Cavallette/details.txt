It was an Oscar Nominee for Best Animated Short in 1991.\r Each piece of history is presented as a simple vignette, usually depicting a few simply-drawn characters arguing and making war, over and over again. Generally, a single figure is meant to stand in for an entire group (i.e., a single Caesar-like caricature for the entire line of Roman Emperors). There is very little spoken dialogue; instead, most of the cartoon is accompanied by a bouncy piano-driven score, which frequently changes style to suit the particular historical era. However, the score is all based around a single simple theme, to which it frequently returns in between vignettes.", "popularity": 0.975, "poster_path": "/zkSkkmYNPzNKZsB9aykispsbNqP.jpg", "release_date": "1990-01-01", "title": "Grasshoppers", "video": false, "vote_average": 7, "vote_count": 17}
