At first Daisy acts shy and has her back turned to her visitor. But Donald soon notices her tailfeathers taking the form of a hand and signaling for him to come closer. But their time alone is soon interrupted by Huey, Dewey and Louie who have followed their uncle and clearly compete with him for the attention of Daisy. Uncle and nephews take turns dancing the jitterbug with her while trying to get rid of each other. In their final effort the three younger Ducks feed their uncle maize in the process of becoming popcorn. The process is completed within Donald himself who continues to move wildly around the house while maintaining the appearance of dancing. The short ends with an impressed Daisy showering her new lover with kisses", "popularity": 3.907, "poster_path": "/tupQQX7DW85spYPwKSBIlx819sG.jpg", "release_date": "1940-06-07", "title": "Mr. Duck Steps Out", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 45}
