Jerry gets reeled in, but that's only the start, particularly once Jerry hides in Spike's mouth and gets Tom to pull Spike's tongue out. Tom hauls a passing dogcatcher in, and he fetches Spike, but Jerry saws off the net, so Spike gives him a dog whistle. A set of earmuffs does the trick as Spike naps, but Jerry shows Tom the earmuffs, so Tom dutifully punishes himself as Jerry carries the duplicate earmuffs over to Spike and settles in for his own nap.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM1ZWI1YzctZTEzYy00ZTNmLTkzYzctMzRlOTdiNGUyY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxODMyODU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "394", "imdbID": "tt0058380", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
