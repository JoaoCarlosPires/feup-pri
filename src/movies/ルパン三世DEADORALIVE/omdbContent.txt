However, he discovers the island is guarded by the Nanomachine, a supercomputer security system which he and his comrades are unable to defeat. The key to getting past Nanomachine lies with the Princess of Zufu, the only surviving member of the royal family; Zufu's current leader General Headhunter had staged a coup d'etat and had the king and prince executed. Lupin's gang successfully make away with the princess, but the ruthless General places a million dollar bounty on Lupin. Meanwhile, Inspector Zenigata makes an alliance with Oleander, a deadly police agent Zufu sent to bring back the princess.
