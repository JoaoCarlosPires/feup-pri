He was in no condition to fight. He was sick, really sick. His disease had whittled him down to a shadow of his former self. He was crippled from a car accident when he was 17 but that's not how he lost his big toe. He lost that in a motorbike accident, yeah he was broken alright - what the hell was he fighting for anyway and what was he still doing in China? His father had given me two clear instructions: 1. Get Techno to stop drinking long enough to receive the liver transplant, and 2. Get him back home to Vancouver. This was not going to be easy.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Canada, United Kingdom", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 1 win & 2 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzczZmRlMzUtOWQwMC00YWNkLWEzZTUtODNiOWE3Y2M4OGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM2Mzc1NTk@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "1,175", "imdbID": "tt5358978", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
