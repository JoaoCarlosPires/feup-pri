After parachuting out of an airplane, he lands in a Japanese forest. He uses an inflated canoe to cross the river, but as soon as it fills up with water, Donald is running for his life. He makes sure the canoe hits nothing that would pop it. When he gets to the edge of a cliff, he sees the airfield. The canoe has already exploded, causing water to flow. This large amount of water splashes onto the airfield, wiping the whole thing clean, but leaving disfigured airplanes", "popularity": 2.434, "poster_path": "/5nU30ujkejqZDiEh8RaX1S1PRiM.jpg", "release_date": "1944-06-02", "title": "Commando Duck", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 21}
