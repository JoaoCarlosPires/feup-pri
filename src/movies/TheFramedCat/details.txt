When Mammy is about to discover him, he hands it off to Jerry; this lets him be a hero to Mammy and still get his chicken. Jerry is miffed, and sees his chance to retaliate: Spike is very possessive of his bone. Jerry keeps stealing the bone and planting it on Tom. Finally, Jerry bores a hole in the bone, inserts a bolt, and gets Tom to swallow a magnet. The bone keeps coming back to Tom, even through a fence. Finally, as Tom runs off followed by Spike, Jerry, who's been hiding in a tin can, is also dragged along.", "popularity": 2.069, "poster_path": "/pxv2X0atQFHvajT2CEbuts91Afi.jpg", "release_date": "1950-10-21", "title": "The Framed Cat", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 17}
