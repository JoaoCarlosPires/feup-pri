Hitler reads about Daffy's scrap pile and about Daffy's stated intent to win the war with junk and, after throwing a fit and chewing a carpet like a mad dog, orders Daffy's scrap pile destroyed. The Nazi weapon for achieving this task is a goat that begins eating the metal in Daffy's junkyard. Inspired by spirits from America's patriotic past, Daffy soars into the air and becomes a \"Super American\" to defeat the goat and fight back against the German submarine that dispatched it. He awakens, thinking this was all a dream, and finds the German submarine at the top of his scrap pile, with a chorus of German soldiers who say, \"Next time you dream, count us out!\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZkM2Q5NGEtZDhkNy00OWE1LWEwODQtZWFmNGFlY2NiODI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc2NTQzMjU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "518", "imdbID": "tt0036334", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
