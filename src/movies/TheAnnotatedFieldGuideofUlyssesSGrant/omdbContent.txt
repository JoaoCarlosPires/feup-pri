Shot on 16mm in national military parks, swamps, forests and the suburban sprawl across the former battlefields, the film follows General Grant's path liberating the southern United States. Part travelogue, part essay film, part landscape documentary, it moves from the Texas-Louisiana border to a prison island off the coast of New England. But instead of relying on actors, vintage photos and the sounds of bullets and explosions, the battles are animated with the paper reenactments of hex and counter war games and bubblegum cards from the hobbyist gamer subcultures that have sprung up around the Civil War. The sound and music are inspired by 70's crime films to celebrate the destruction of the Confederacy with the synth jams they deserve.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg0MGQ1OWQtMTNhMS00YjAwLWFlNTYtMTE4MTcyYzNmNTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY4MDA2NTE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.2", "imdbVotes": "9", "imdbID": "tt13332834", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
