A white dropout struggles to create comics and animated films, drawing inspiration from the harsh, gritty world around him. Still sharing his run-down apartment with his middle-aged parents, an oafish slob of an Italian father and a ditzy nut-case of a Jewish mother, he is ridiculed and looked down upon by his friends, hypocrites who run with violent gangs and the Italian Mafia, and a shallow Black girl who makes her living downtown with the pimps and pushers. This cartoonist gets a chance to pitch a film idea to a movie mogul, but the story proves too outrageous: a far-future Earth, destroyed by war and pollution, where a mutant antihero challenges and kills God. Complications ensue when the cartoonist's parents react in irrational ways to his various involvements.", "Language": "English, Italian, Yiddish", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE5MWY4ZDItM2JlMS00MzIwLWIyMWQtNTlmOTliNjk4YmQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.6/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "89%"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.6", "imdbVotes": "3,161", "imdbID": "tt0070165", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "05 Sep 2000", "BoxOffice": "$1,343,341", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
