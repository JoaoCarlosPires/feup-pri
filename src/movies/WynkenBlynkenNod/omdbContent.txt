A star hooks two candy-cane baited lines together. The stars tease the baby while he's hanging overboard. A comet comes through; they catch it in a net and it tows them wildly, until they land in another cloud, where they are tossed by storms, eventually breaking their mast and sending them back to earth (and their bed, where we see they are really one boy).", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWZhNDY3ZWItNGQ5NS00NGU5LTgyZDItMTRjNzk1Mzk0ZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxODMyODU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "589", "imdbID": "tt0030988", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
