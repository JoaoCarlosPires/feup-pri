"Conclusion to the The Long Halloween is solid and taken as a whole, a fine adaptation to a great graphic novel. It's not to the standards of The Dark Knight Returns animated movie but a step up from Batman: Hush and its lame change to the villain's identity. Some nice character moments and decent voice work but no real stand outs. Looking forward to the release bridging the two parts together and checking it out in one sitting and see how it holds up.\r\n\r\n3.5/5 - Part One\r\n\r\n4.0/5 - Part Two""\n"
