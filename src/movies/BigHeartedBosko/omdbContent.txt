Bruno accidentally falls through the ice. The canny canine allows Bosko to think he has drowned before finally popping out of a hollow tree and barking out a greeting. Bosko is momentarily angry, but quickly forgives him. The fun ends when the two of them discover a baby abandoned in the snow. Bosko takes the infant to his cabin. The unlovable bundle does nothing but bawl and bawl, and finally infuriates Bruno when it declares its reason: it's crying for the Carolines. Undaunted, Bosko finally finds a way to make the crying baby laugh--but not without a near-drowning of his own.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDc2MDQ0NzEtYWJjMi00MzE5LTliNjctZDAwZjhkOWVkZGQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxMzM3NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.1", "imdbVotes": "139", "imdbID": "tt0022679", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
