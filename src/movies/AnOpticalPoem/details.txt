A title card tells us this is an experiment in conveying the mental images of music in a visual form. Liszt's \"Second Hungarian Rhapsody\" is the music. The shapes, all two-dimensional, are circles primarily, with some squares and rectangles, and a few triangles. The shapes move rhythmically to the music: receding from view or moving across the screen. Red circles on a blue background; light blue squares; white rectangles. Then, a red background of many circles with a few in the foreground. Red gives way to blue then to white. Shapes reappear as Liszt's themes re-occur. Then, with a few staccato notes and images, it's over.", "popularity": 1.031, "poster_path": "/pokgqXg7jOX2NtAd7naE6ExpvoA.jpg", "release_date": "1938-03-05", "title": "An Optical Poem", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 29}
