"I love Tex Avery and the MGM cartoon team's style of animation very much, and this imitation to cash in on Looney Tunes' Tweety and Sylvester comedy team was riotously hilarious. I found it as an extra on my DVD of 'East Side West Side', from my excellent Barbara Stanwyck TCM 4-pack. Highly recommended to any fan of the classic cartoons.""\n"
