"Certainly not a bad piece, but it discards the one thing that is most responsible for _Regular Show's_ success: Its ten minute run time. Now it's obvious why that decision was made, wouldn't be much call for a feature film with a ten minute run time, but the bite-size servings is a major part of the program's appeal. Here, we obviously don't have that, so \"_Regular Show: The Movie_\", is only okay.\r\n\r\nAlso, why isn't it called _Regular Movie_?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._""\n"
