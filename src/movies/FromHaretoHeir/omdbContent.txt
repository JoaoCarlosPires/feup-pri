Sam, the Duke of Yosemite, learns that the King has cut off his allowance and takes his frustrations out on his servant by slamming his large nose in the book. Just as he's complaining about where to get more funds, Bugs Bunny comes to the door. The bunny offers 1 million pounds to a mild-tempered person - he picks Sam - then provides an anger-management catch: If Sam loses his temper for any reason, Bugs gets to subtract from the balance. Sam, anxious for the cash, quickly becomes mild-tempered and welcomes Bugs into his palace. The rest of the cartoon depicts Bugs playing the role of annoying house guest, seemingly to test Sam's temper and patience. Sam loses every time, as he blows his cool when he's asked repeatedly to pass the salt, pepper and ketchup; Bugs hears Sam grumble under his breath and deducts from his cash account; Sam can't even go outside to vent his anger without Bugs knowing about it. That night, Bugs keeps Sam awake with an obnoxious rendition of \"I Dream of Jeannie (With the Light Brown Hair),\" and then a one-man-band rendition of \"Braham's Lullaby.\" The next morning, Bugs hogs the bathroom, and when Sam continues to lose his temper, he realizes that, at this rate, the only way to get whatever is left of his inheritance is to kill the bunny off and make it look like an accident. But Sam twice falls victim to a hole he saws in the floor (right in front of the bathroom); both times, Sam falls into a river far below the main floor. Later, Sam disguises himself as a statue knight in armor, ready to behead Bugs as he's climbing a long, winding set of stairs; Sam misses completely with his wild swing, loses his balance and tumbles down the stairs, cursing all the way. Bugs continues the deductions. In the end, Sam declares to Bugs that he has his temper under control, demonstrating by allowing the servants to throw pies in his face and beat him on the head. Bugs confides to the audience: \"I haven't got the heart to tell him he's used up all the money.\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI5ZTAxMjUtMWRhZi00OGUxLWExNmMtYTJmNjg2Y2FlZGU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE1NjY5Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.8", "imdbVotes": "498", "imdbID": "tt0053840", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
