But the horse's mother pulls him away, saying we don't associate with that kind. Spunky makes a few more overtures, and eventually they set off on a chase, running across a bull from time to time. The horse stops to eat a lot of apples and drink far too much water; this leaves him too bloated to move much at all. The two continue to anger the bull, which gives chase; Spunky saves the colt, and they all live in harmony.", "popularity": 0.841, "poster_path": "/AoaL6Flu1ffAmX4KJI160yayvx4.jpg", "release_date": "1940-07-18", "title": "Snubbed by a Snob", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
