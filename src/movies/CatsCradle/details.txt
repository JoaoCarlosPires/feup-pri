A woman is in a bedroom, another wears an apron: they work with their hands, occasionally looking up. A man enters a room, a woman smiles. He sits, another man sits and smokes. The cat stretches.

She pets the cat.", "popularity": 1.908, "poster_path": "/gMLoPZAHhdnUIOAE7w3UuCjVVQA.jpg", "release_date": "1959-01-01", "title": "Cat's Cradle", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 30}
