Despite working in a post office all his life, Gerard has dreamed of one day finding his audience as a famous magician like his childhood hero. With effortless dexterity that accompanies mastery, this delightfully overgrown kid practices magic every day with a special coin...a gift from The Great Vivonti. When an inquisitive young girl named Jules wanders upon his practiced routine, she's dazzled by his talents. With the help of his cherished coin, Gerard charms his first-ever audience member with an impromptu magic show. In this moment, two artists-separated by decades-unknowingly set off a chain reaction that will change both of their lives forever.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "8 wins & 5 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVlZGJkNzEtM2RlMC00NWViLWFhOGMtZmVhZDM2NDc3YTgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjExNjgyMTc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "520", "imdbID": "tt11952320", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
