Touched by this devotion, the Saint appears to the peasant and offers him four wishes. Villain tells his robust and disbelieving wife, who laughingly makes a wish for anatomical changes in her husband. Saint Martin complies, and Villain replies in kind with a wish of his own about his wife's body. They're now in a fix; the woman makes another wish, and the two are left with less than that with which they started. They do have a final, inevitable wish. His work done, Saint Martin sighs and departs for Heaven after a last word of advice.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France", "Awards": "1 nomination", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.7", "imdbVotes": "12", "imdbID": "tt0242800", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
