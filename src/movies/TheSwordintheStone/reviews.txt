"Decent watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.\r\n\r\nNow it's been a while since I've seen this one, and now I remember why.  There just isn't anything in the well in which to return.  Sure all the magic is amusing, and the animal adventures are cute, as well as a nice reminder of how good we have it as humans, but I really feel like we ruined that squirrel's life, and I'm sad about it.\r\n\r\nThe actual story of the sword in the stone is very short, because it's not interesting: it's all the adventures that Arthur has growing the kingdom, establishing rule over (what would be) England, and his adventures as an adult king (most of which were his knights') to include warring with neighbors.\r\n\r\nWhile the jocks versus nerds analogy through the movie is interesting, it feels polarizing, and the message of education / knowledge is mixed throughout the movie.  Future references to the (1963) present just dates the movie and aren't all that funny, and it tells the audience that just because you have knowledge, doesn't mean you can use it.  Then in the 3rd act, we start a controversy over having knowledge / skills can be used to better or worsen things, and other than inspiring Star Wars, I don't know what the point of it was.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part was when Archimedes got to laugh: he seemed like he really needed it.""\n"
