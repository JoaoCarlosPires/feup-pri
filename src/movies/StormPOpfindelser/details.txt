Opfindelser", "overview": "This puppet film recreates some of Danish humorist Storm P.'s popular cartoons - the so-called \"inventions\". A \"Storm P. Invention\" is how Danes would describe a highly complicated technical design. The design of these apparatuses reflects an original satirical view on a society obsessed by efficiency and technocratization. The fun is derived from the lack of proportion between the diminutive scale of the problem and incomprehensible complexity of Storm P.'s solution.", "popularity": 0.841, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "2001-08-13", "title": "Storm P.
