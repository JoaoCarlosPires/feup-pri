Though Shiki protests, he leaves the cat anyway, and Shiki is stuck trying to understand her new feline companion. But as luck would have it, the cat seems to have taken a liking to Mikiya and misses him. Later in another part of the city, Ririsu Miyazuki visits the place where her dear friend committed suicide. She intends to end her life as well, but she meets Fujino Asagami, a blind classmate with a traumatic past. Though the two girls don't have much in common, Asagami reminds Miyazuki of her lost friend and helps her understand her pain. Two months later, Mikiya elects to celebrate New Year's with Shiki instead of his family, which makes his sister Azaka very upset, leading to her spending the holiday with her school friends. As the snow begins to fall, Mikiya reflects on what he wishes for most of all: that Shiki's life be filled with happiness.", "popularity": 3.097, "poster_path": "/m3NjvBhnbZaZfjBCv7VBNrJ7RLY.jpg", "release_date": "2013-09-28", "title": "The Garden of Sinners: Recalled Out Summer \u2013 Extra Chorus", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 20}
