He goes to his throne and summons his jester, Goopy Geer. Various bits of silliness ensue (including an Amos &amp; Andy impression cut in some versions). A black knight arrives and threatens one of the young ladies in court; Goopy fights him off, first with an ax, then in armor from kitchen utensils, then butting him with a mounted animal head, which makes the knight's armor fall apart. He pulls it together again and runs away.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY0YjJhZjktYWU3MC00Yzc3LWFjNjUtZDRmNjIwOWFiYzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY2ODU5MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.0", "imdbVotes": "157", "imdbID": "tt0023364", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
