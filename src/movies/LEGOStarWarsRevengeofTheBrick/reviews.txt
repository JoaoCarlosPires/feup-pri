"Very poor attempt no doubt, but kinda worth it to see the decent end credits scene with Darth Vader.\r\n\r\nTo make <em>'Lego Star Wars: Revenge of The Brick'</em> with no dialogue was an interesting choice, one I actually didn't mind - helped by the ultra short 5 minute run time. The animation style, though, is horrific.""\n"
