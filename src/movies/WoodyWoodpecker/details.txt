He infuriates the other woodland creatures - when he isn't baffling them with his bizarre behavior. Woody overhears a squirrel and a group of birds gossiping about him. Even though he just sang a song proclaiming his craziness, he denies their whispered accusations that he's nuts. But after they trick him into knocking his head on a statue, the poor bird hears voices in his head and decides the animals might be right. He decides to see a doctor. But leave it to Woody to choose Dr. Horace N. Buggy, a Scottish-brogue-burring fox, who is, if it's impossible, even madder than he is.", "popularity": 1.808, "poster_path": "/6oV40uVKadL0VhtilkZAaBj0JqL.jpg", "release_date": "1941-07-16", "title": "Woody Woodpecker", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 20}
