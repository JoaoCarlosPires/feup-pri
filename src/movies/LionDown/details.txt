He immediately decides to get another one but he shows poor judgement in regards that the one he picks is unkowingly the home of a mountain lion. The lion returns to Goofy's penthouse to reclaim his tree, notices the hammock, and decides this is a much better source of relaxation than laying on a tree branch. Thus, he tries to remove Goofy from the hammock so he can relax himself and eventually a battle ensues.", "popularity": 1.12, "poster_path": "/swSOzBicz7P1ECXcQqldNIVHyAV.jpg", "release_date": "1951-01-05", "title": "Lion Down", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 16}
