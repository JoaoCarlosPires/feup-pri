He lustfully pursues her into the Louvre art gallery, where his foul scent causes the images in several paintings to change poses to show their disgust. The female cat's feline lover has also come into the Louvre and challenges Pepe to a duel for possession of her, but is thwarted by Pepe's unbearable stench.", "popularity": 1.881, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1962-08-18", "title": "Louvre Come Back to Me!", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 14}
