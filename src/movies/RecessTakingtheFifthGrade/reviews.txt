"Thankfully better than <em>'Recess: All Growed Down'</em>, but <em>'Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade'</em> is still a bit of a chore to watch.\r\n\r\nThis again features a couple of different stories, though to be fair their integration into the film is much improved if still a bit messy. The cast are as they've always been, solid but not exactly memorable. Animation-wise it's decent.\r\n\r\nThis is more on the level of <em>'Recess Christmas: Miracle On Third Street'</em>, yet still miles off <em>'Recess: School\u2019s Out'</em>. I simply don't understand why they didn't create three unique stories for these sequels, as they did for the original production. Compiled stories are, in my opinion, lazy.\r\n\r\nNot a series of films that I'll be revisiting, but they are ones that have pretty respectable ratings across a few platforms so it seems I'm in the minority. Each to their own, as always!""\n"
