He gets out, and his tug of war with Mickey and the towel lands Mickey in the tub. The soap jumps out, and Pluto swallows it, hic-cupping soap bubbles as Mickey chases him. Pluto gets out, and the people on the street think Pluto is rabid and start hiding and throwing things at him. Dogcatcher Pete comes along, and prepares to shoot Pluto. Mickey catches up to him just in time. He tries pleading, then fighting, but they get away when Mickey throws a kitten into Pete's pants. In the ensuing chase, a fruit cart provides more diversions, and ultimately they manage to crash Pete into his own truck.", "popularity": 2.013, "poster_path": "/q8WxRkmXpjru1pmSF3aRBpj9LJy.jpg", "release_date": "1932-03-05", "title": "The Mad Dog", "video": false, "vote_average": 5, "vote_count": 18}
