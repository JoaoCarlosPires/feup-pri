She's finishing getting ready, so she introduces him to her dog, which loves to fetch a small red rubber ball with blue stars. He tosses the ball to the dog a few times, somewhat distractedly, looks through a book (\"Do I have to be me?\") on her coffee table, opens the French doors to her balcony, sits down and continues to toss the ball. It takes a deadly carom, but when she emerges from her bedroom ready to go, he stays mum. Outside the building, a crowd has gathered. Will he tell her what happened, or leave it for her to put together? Is there any way out for him?", "Language": "English", "Country": "Australia", "Awards": "3 wins & 2 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTUzOGIxNTEtYWE0ZC00OGJhLTkxMTQtY2U3MWFkMGYwMmEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM3ODU0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "65", "imdbID": "tt0157632", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
