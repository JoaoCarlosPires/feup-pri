A rooster rousts the chickens and geese. The chicks run out from under a huge hen, leaving her much smaller. She digs for a worm by turning her bill into a brace and bit, then divides the worm among the kids by running it through a meat grinder. One of the chicks has a fight with one of the resulting worms. An expectant father rooster fetches doctor stork, who comes out with a basket full of white chicks and one little black one, who gets crowded out of the food. Seeing a fenced in garden, he sings the title song. Finding a discarded girdle, he uses it as wings, and a pair of bloomers as a parachute. Feast time! That is, until the scarecrow comes after him, but he's quickly dispatched.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDljYWYxYjEtZWRhMC00YTNiLTg3NTMtMzFiYzJhOWEzMThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxMzM3NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.5", "imdbVotes": "97", "imdbID": "tt0023044", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
