The gent can't find his wallet, so he orders espresso after espresso as he ponders what to do. The vagabond returns, a napping nun at the next table gives him money, and the gent considers pilfering her purse. As the evening drags on, the bill for espresso mounts. A detective tacks up a wanted poster.
