"<I>All outcomes are possible...</I>\r\n\r\nRight off the bat this movie feels like an animated comic taken from the pages of EC Comics and styled like an episode from Archer. The story is pretty good and I do love some time manipulation in a story.\r\n\r\nThe gore is animated so it can be over the top if needed. The twist in the movie is definitely a great one though slightly predictable since we are dealing with greed, power, and time warping abilities.\r\n\r\nThere isn't that many animated horror movies out there, especially ones that isn't focused on kids viewing this. So I'm happy to see this and hopefully this doesn't get slept on.  It is a decent movie.""\n"
