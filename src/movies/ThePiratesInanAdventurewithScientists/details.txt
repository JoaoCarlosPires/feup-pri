With a rag-tag crew at his side, and seemingly blind to the impossible odds stacked against him, the Captain has one dream: to beat his bitter rivals Black Bellamy and Cutlass Liz to the much coveted Pirate of the Year Award. It\u2019s a quest that takes our heroes from the shores of exotic Blood Island to the foggy streets of Victorian London.
