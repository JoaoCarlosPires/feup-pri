"A fun one to watch.\r\n\r\n<em>'Cars'</em> is very good Disney, not quite in the upper echelons of their releases but certainly close. The voice cast do a lot of grand work, while the animation is super. I also like the tension building and set-up of the racing stuff, even if they don't take the overly realistic approach - which is fine.\r\n\r\nOwen Wilson is terrific as Lightning McQueen, while Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable Guy give noteworthy performances as Sally and Mater. The rest of the cast are good, including Michael Keaton (Chick Hicks). There's yet another role for John Ratzenberger, who features in a funny end credits gag.\r\n\r\nSolid soundtrack, amusing humour and it even has a decent amount of heart to it too. Would recommend.""\n"
