Tai and Matt head back to the Internet to deal with him with Omnimon, while the younger Chosen Children go to deal with the rampage of a swarm of Kuramon (Diaboromon's Fresh form). With the help of Angemon and Angewomon (with T.K. and Kari), Omnimon was able to destroy Diaboromon again, but it turned out to be a trap, as his destruction allowed many more Kuramon to go to the Real World. Things go out of control when the Kuramon in the Real World merge to create a Mega level called Armageddemon, an alternate Mega in Diaboromon's evolutionary line. It is so powerful that neither Omnimon nor Imperialdramon were able to defeat it on their own.", "popularity": 4.822, "poster_path": "/lXnknKFbFG32leAdQr4PCJ0nTM5.jpg", "release_date": "2001-03-03", "title": "Digimon Adventure 02: Revenge of Diaboromon", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 35}
