"Rather than offering an even more potent ending, \u2018Toy Story 4\u2019 ends up being an unnecessary epilogue, offering little to enrich the overall narrative of the series and never cashing in on the actual possibilities it offers. This could have worked if it had explored a new story in the 'Toy Story' universe, and Forky certainly makes it clear that such a move could have worked beautifully. Instead, we have a film that feels tired and forced, lacking in clarity or inspiration, serving neither its classic characters or its new ones, and ultimately never justifying its existence. It\u2019s certainly an enjoyable film, but it\u2019s hardly a necessary one.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-toy-story-4-entertaining-but-thoroughly-unnecessary""\n""I very much enjoyed _Toy Story 4_. I thought it was good, and I think it doesn't at all \"undo\" the perfect ending that the third entry gave us, which was a legitimate fear some people had. What I will say however, is that I don't understand **just how much** most people seem to have loved it. I have seen multiple people say it's the best of the four, and I more think it's the... worst. That's not a knock! This is a **seriously** good series (and also I think it might actually be either better than or maybe as good _Toy Story 2_). But I am not quite feeling the **overwhelming** positivity that it has garnered from a lot of my peers. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._""\n""Dang, is it dusty in here? After what was a near perfect conclusion with Toy Story 3, wasn't sure if this was really needed. I'm glad they did go through with it and although it's not exactly unpredictable, still was highly entertaining with some genuine emotions and a great finale for Woody. Really says a lot that as good as this was, it's still the fourth best movie of the series. **4.0/5**\r\n\r\nDon't really want a TS5 but wouldn't mind some short Toy Story Toons with the group...""\n""Not entirely necessary, but <em>'Toy Story 4'</em> still produces goods worthy of being attached to the initial trilogy.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks, I'm sounding like a broken record but..., is still tremendous as Woody, I love hearing his voice in this role. Tim Allen is solid as Buzz Lightyear, but I kinda feel they don't use him - or the other originals - enough considering who they are. It is, though, cool to see an old face return in Bo Peep (Annie Potts).\r\n\r\nThere are some more new characters and yet again, like in the past films, they strike the right chords. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are, entirely unsurprisingly, funny in the roles of Ducky & Bunny. Christina Hendricks is a good Gabby, while Keanu Reeves amuses as Duke Caboom.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses on giving the viewer(s) extremely heartfelt moments and for the vast majority it hits as intended, though they do try to tug on the heart too much in parts. The animation is stunning, especially in the early scene with RC.\r\n\r\nIs it a thing everyone wanted? Most probably not. Yet is there fun to be had? Most definitely. For a third sequel, you gotta give respect to Pixar & Co.""\n"
