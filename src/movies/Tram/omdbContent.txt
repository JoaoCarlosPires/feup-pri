As every morning, men get on the tram to go to work, one after another, all similar, quiet, grey, apathetic. And yet, on that day, following the jolts and the road's vibrations, to the rhythm of the tickets inserted in the ticket-stamping machine, the conductress gets turned on and the vehicle gets erotic. The tram conductress' desire turns the reality into a surrealistic and phallic fantasy. She then takes a ride on the passenger's giant and blushing penises.
