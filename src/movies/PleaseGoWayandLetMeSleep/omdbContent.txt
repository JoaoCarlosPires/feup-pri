Growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, with parents who were born during the 1910s and 1920s, I was familiar with large swaths of popular culture from the 1930s, from relatives, from television viewings, and through the kitchen radio, always tuned to WNEW and the Make Believe Ball Room.But I have no memory of this cartoon or song at all. And because familiarity breeds not contempt, but acceptance, I thought it slow and dull. Oh, the gags that precede the song are as good as always, but the animation was pretty poor, with the character design not up to the Fleischers' usual standards.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "4.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "4.2", "imdbVotes": "19", "imdbID": "tt0022270", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
