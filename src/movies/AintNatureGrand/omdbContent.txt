He feels sorry for the worm he's brought; instead he uses the letters on the sign to act as worms. He catches a fish, declares it cute and pets it. The fish spits at him and jumps back into the water. Meanwhile, the worm is not safe yet. A bird chases him; but he escapes into a hole. We're back to Bosko who finds two ladybugs dancing on stones next to a waterfall as a spider plays his web as a harp. A pelican rises up from the water to deposit four frogs next to Bosko. Bosko and the frogs sing and dance. The two ladybugs are mischievous; they use a wasp as an airplane, a flower as a propeller, and a beehive and tree branch as a machine gun. They shoot Bosko with bees, driving him away and into a water fountain. But the happy Bosko tips his hat to the audience to show he's all right.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ2NmNiODQtZDk4YS00OTkxLTk0NmEtYTM3NGM5NTNiNzg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxMzM3NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.3", "imdbVotes": "191", "imdbID": "tt0021590", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
