Fields, leads tours of a drugstore for other mice. We see a number of products living up to their names: vanishing cream, reducing pills, sleeping powders, smelling salts, cough medicine. On to the lunch counter: a giant malt (sign). More products: shaving brush, Krazy mineral water, a rubber band (and brushes dancing to it). A musical revue: the clocks all sing \"Start the Day Right\"; an order pad would \"Love to Take Orders From You\"; a ballet troupe wants to \"Shake Your Powder Puff\"; and so on. Greeting cards greet our tourists. The mousetraps are harmless but the cat next to them isn't, and thus ends the tour. An annoying little boy who's been chatting away the whole time finally gets a jar of alum in the face to shut him up.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc3MzM5ZTUtYjRiOC00YjkyLWFkYjItNTU1MWE2ZWViMzZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxMzM3NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.2", "imdbVotes": "107", "imdbID": "tt0032715", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
