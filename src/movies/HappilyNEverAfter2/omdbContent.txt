This time Princess Snow White is a misguided teenager who'd rather have fun with friends Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks and Little Bo Peep than help peasants. When Snow White's father is matched up with Lady Vain - a scheming witch brewing to rule the kingdom - Snow White becomes a thorn in Lady Vain's side. Snow White is soon tricked by Lady Vain (with Rumpelstiltskin's help) into spreading vicious gossip about the townspeople, forcing her to flee. Through rebuilding the three little pigs' houses with the seven dwarves leading the way, Snow White learns the value of helping others. Only Snow White can foil her dad's wedding to stop Lady Vain. With Mambo and Munk in tow, Snow White proves she can rule the kingdom, while bringing balance back to the scales of good and evil.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, Germany", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQ1Mjg5ZWUtODA2Ny00ODgxLWFmOTktMGZkMWQyZTM2NjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgyODgxNjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "3.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "3.8", "imdbVotes": "1,820", "imdbID": "tt1235837", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "24 Mar 2009", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
