"I don't mind me a musical, but I feel like the biggest issue with _Strange Magic_ is the way they went with it musically. Not only was I just personally not a big fan of the singing voices on literally all but one of the characters, but I just think the continuous run of on-the-nose pop songs from beginning to end basically flat out ruined what seemed to be a promising movie.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n"
