"Perfectly fine for what it is.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special'</em> is OK, not necessarily good or bad. A couple of the actors carry over from the <em>'Star Wars'</em> franchise itself, though the vast majority of main stars from the aforementioned do not. The plot is split three ways in terms of how I enjoyed them.\r\n\r\nThe best stuff, for me, is the bits with Palpatine and Darth Vader, Trevor Devall undoubtedly gives the best voice performance as the former. The parts with Rey, who is voiced unconvincingly and borderline irritatingly by Helen Sadler, is watchable. Lastly, the stuff with Finn & Co. is uninteresting filler.\r\n\r\nOn Sadler's story in this, I did enjoy seeing them go back through the films from the main  franchise - though I would've liked it more if they did it in a more clever and amusing way, \u00e0 la <em>'The Lion King 1\u00bd'</em> with the Pride Rock scene.\r\n\r\nAt just 44mins and with the nessacary - if not a great deal of - festive vibe, it's practically impossible to dislike this... at least for me. It's also light years ahead of its 1978 predecessor, not that that's difficult mind.""\n"
