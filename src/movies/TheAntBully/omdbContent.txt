His parents, Fred (Larry Miller) and Doreen (Cheri Oteri), are leaving for a honeymoon in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, so they are too busy to attend to his problems.

One wizard ant, known as Zoc (Nicolas Cage), being a hopeful and adventurous type, is trying to solve this dilemma. He tries to devise a magic potion that he believes will solve all their problems. As the plan to shrink Lucas down to their size with a magic potion and forcing him to live like an ant within the colony - an astonishing new world opens up to him.
