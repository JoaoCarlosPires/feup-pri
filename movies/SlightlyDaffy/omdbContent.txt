Porky sleeps too soundly, so Daffy needs to roust him, but when the Indians attack, he's the only one awake to see them. There follows a series of fight gags, including some recycled from Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas (1938) and The Hardship of Miles Standish (1940). A cross-eyed Indian keeps shooting his own horse, until the horse takes action. A soldier counts \"one little, two little...\" with the Indian taking the last line. A short Indian uses a tall bow-legged one to shoot his arrows. Finally, Porky calls for more bullets; Daffy trips while carrying them and swallows them, turning himself into a machine gun. Porky uses Daffy to rout the Indians, who run into a hillside, spelling out \"Yanks beat Indians 11-3.\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA0Njk1NTMtNWI2OC00M2NjLWIwMzUtOWEyOTU3N2NkMTFiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTY5NjE5NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "170", "imdbID": "tt0037285", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
