"Admittedly not terrible, but I didn't enjoy watching <em>'Arjun: The Warrior Prince'</em>.\r\n\r\nThe animation is the biggest hamper - it's pretty poor, you expect so much more from a Disney film; I get the budget is more than likely much lower than what they'd give to a full blown US release, but I feel they could've done better. Some parts of it are decent, but the rougher parts stand out big.\r\n\r\nI didn't dislike the premise, necessarily. Sure it isn't crafted to perfection or anywhere close, but the actual idea itself is solid. I can't say any of the voice cast stand out, though Yuddvir Bakolia fits OK-ish as the titular character.\r\n\r\nAnimation is one let down, another is the pacing. There's pieces of action here and there, but the ending lacks something enthralling - I didn't care for how it was going to conclude. It's predictable which doesn't help, but that can be overcome if it's entertaining to watch unfold - this, unfortunately, isn't.""\n"
