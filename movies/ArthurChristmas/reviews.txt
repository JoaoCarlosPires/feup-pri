The plot is a little light, with a fairly simple event taking a relative while to resolve itself, but it's still a pleasant festive animated film - with neat animation.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of familiar names on the voice cast, too many to name in actual fact. My personal standout is Hugh Laurie as Steven, though James McAvoy, Bill Nighy and Jim Broadbent are all enjoyable too.", "created_at": "2020-12-18T17:59:43.863Z", "id": "5fdcee0fb6c264003e060232", "updated_at": "2021-06-23T15:58:48.925Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5fdcee0fb6c264003e060232"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}
