A film experiment that deals with the photoreality and the surrealism of life. A collage-animation that cuts up photos and newsreel film and reassembles them, producing an image that is a mixture of unexplainable fact (Why is Harpo Marx playing a harp in the middle of a battlefield?) with inexplicable act (Why is there a battlefield?). It is a black comedy, a fantasy that mocks death ... a parabolic parable.", "popularity": 1.171, "poster_path": "/733b00qcMuHGVRXqLyg7yLxfNQv.jpg", "release_date": "1963-12-28", "title": "Breathdeath", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 9}
