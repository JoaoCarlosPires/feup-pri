Bugs Bunny awakens to the horror of reposing mummies, an Evil Scientist with a huge, green head and an enormous robot waiting for its brain. Bugs tries to escape, but the scientist sends Rudolph after him. Rudolph is an unlikely beast covered with orange fur; it wears sneakers, but why not? Who says monsters don't have sensitive feet? Bugs poses as a chatty hairdresser, uses vanishing fluid on himself, and pours reducing fluid on the beast to thwart him. But Bugs's only weapon against the Evil Scientist will be a broken bottle of ether. Will it be enough?", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg2ZTVkYTMtMGNlOS00NmVmLWE2MDktYjczYTllMjQ5ZWNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.0", "imdbVotes": "2,012", "imdbID": "tt0045315", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$14,753", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
