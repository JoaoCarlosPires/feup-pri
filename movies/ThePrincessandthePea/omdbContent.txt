Because the evil prince Laird did not inherit the crown of Corazion, he sought his revenge by secretly switching his newborn daughter with that of his brother's, King Heath. The real princess is raised as a peasant, unaware of her royal lineage. Years later, Prince Rollo comes to the kingdom in search of a wife. Unless Sebastian, the court historian, discovers the secret of the pea, dire consequences await the kingdom of Corazion. The plot thickens when Rollo meets and falls in love with a peasant girl. Though she is everything his heart desires, she is not a princess. With time running out, Laird returns with a scheme that could put him on the throne.
