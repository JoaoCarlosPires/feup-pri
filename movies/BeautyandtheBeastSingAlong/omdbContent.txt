{"Title": "Beauty and the Beast Sing-Along", "Year": "2020", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "17 Jan 2020", "Runtime": "N/A", "Genre": "Animation, Short", "Director": "Don Hahn", "Writer": "N/A", "Actors": "Jesse Corti, Angela Lansbury, Paige O'Hara", "Plot": "Narrated by Angela Lansbury, the sing-along is an abridged version of the film focused on the efforts of LeFou helping to bring Belle and The Beast together in a style similar to \"The Lion King 1\u00bd\". After a quick abridged version of Belle introducing LeFou in stocks instead of helping Gaston's duck-hunting, the narrator explains that LeFou turned on Gaston after the failed marriage proposal caused him to be thrown into the mud. Having heard stories about a beast in a nearby spooky castle, LeFou decides to lure Maurice there and in turn, Belle, to try and break the curse. After Belle arrives in the castle, LeFou sneaks into the kitchen and helps cook the food served in Be Our Guest. When Belle leaves the castle after entering the West Wing, LeFou pursues her into the woods to try and bring her back, but ends up re-uniting with Gaston who is still in a bad mood. Trying to keep his mind off of Belle and to cheer him up, LeFou and the villagers perform Gaston. Having cheered him up, LeFou rushes back to the castle in time to help Belle and Beast bond, being behind various events shown during Something There's montage. LeFou then assists in preparing for the romantic dinner and dance shown in Beauty and the Beast by making and trying on Belle's dancing gown, playing the violin and setting the mood with lighting in the ballroom. Just as the dance ends, he sees that Gaston and the villagers have come to the castle to kill the Beast. When Gaston falls and the Beast is restored to his human form, LeFou sets off the fireworks as the castle is restored, the film ending on a stained glass window featuring LeFou in the spotlight as the story's hero.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJmMDI5Y2MtZWNhOS00YmNmLWI3OGQtM2E0NWVjM2U5NTE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc5ODkzNDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "N/A", "imdbVotes": "N/A", "imdbID": "tt11683332", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
