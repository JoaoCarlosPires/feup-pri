"A quick cash-in for the holidays? Sure, but by keeping the spirit of the Trolls movie going, as well as having the orginal star-studded cast on board, this is cute and fun, with some catchy songs, and won't grate on you too much if you only have to watch it once a year.... which if your kids love Trolls as much as mine, won't be the case...""\n"
