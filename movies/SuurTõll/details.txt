Though he was king of the island, T\u00f5ll often worked as a common farmer, tending to his crops and returning to his loving wife, Piret. He was a good king, often quick to anger but always kind and willing to help his fellow man. T\u00f5ll's greatest enemy is a devil by the name of Vanat\u00fchi (\"Old empty one,\" \"Old vile one\"), the god of the underworld who specializes in sly, cowardly mischief. In this film, when War comes to Saaremaa, T\u00f5ll arrives to aid his dying army, but the evil Vanat\u00fchi takes advantage of his absence to wreak havoc on T\u00f5ll's home.", "popularity": 1.261, "poster_path": "/3sNX2MXIb4rzRXBLfokBqbI3Ls6.jpg", "release_date": "1980-09-15", "title": "Tyll the Giant", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 13}
