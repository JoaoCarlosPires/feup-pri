In Finding Babel, Andrei Malaev-Babel confronts complex traces of a turbulent history that echo in his grandfather's writing and in the conflicts of today's Ukraine and Russia. Babel's fiction is woven into Andrei's search with ethereal animation that puts the viewer, like Babel's readers, between fantasy and reality.", "popularity": 1.826, "poster_path": "/bykmn6mXNKVwpZ4zy8jFlVqE6oz.jpg", "release_date": "2015-10-29", "title": "Finding Babel", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 3}
