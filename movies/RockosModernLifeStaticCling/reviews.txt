"Opens on the statement \"I don't think we're in the nineties anymore\" then **immediately** moves on to a visual gag about the state of the modern world that that _The Simpsons_ **literally made in 1998**. Pretty much broadcasts the attitude of the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nI did see a lot of _Rocko's Modern Life_ when I was a kid, but I never much liked it. _Static Cling_, which thinks that pointing out the fact that VR goggles... Exist? I guess?... Is the same thing as making a joke, did not change that for me.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605 - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._""\n"
