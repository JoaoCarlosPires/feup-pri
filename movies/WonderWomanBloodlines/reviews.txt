"I don't remember a whole lot from the 2009 animated movie but this reboot bringing in-line with the DC Animated Universe was rather disappointing. The plot itself was okay but disjointed, however its biggest sin was atrocious dialogue combined with some weak voice acting, particularly on the part of Jeffrey Donovan as Steve Trevor while Rosario Dawson, returning to voice Wonder Woman, was fine but hardly noteworthy. This is towards the bottom in an otherwise pretty decent DCAU (though not on the best streak as The Reign of the Supermen and Batman: Hush were also disappointments). **2.5/5**""\n""Sam Liu has direct a lot of DC's straight-to-video animated features. I think just by virtue of doing so many, this means he's done some of their best ones. This also means he's done a lot of crap ones. _Wonder Woman: Bloodlines_ is one of the better crap ones.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n"
