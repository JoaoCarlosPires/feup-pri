They seem reasonably happy, but there's an underlying conflict. Peter really loves children. He wants to get married and start a family. Eri doesn't want children and sees no reason to get married. Their happiness gradually erodes, and eventually Eri leaves to \"think about things.\" Peter's editor, Reiko, who wonders if she'd be a better match for Peter, unravels the underlying reason for Eri's reluctance. Peter must then make a choice. Will he give Eri up, in order to have a family, or will he accede to her feelings, in order to be with her? There's no easy answer.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/DwoVMhOPfq6gaZi0xrruMfICId.jpg", "release_date": "1992-07-03", "title": "Shin Dousei Jidai: Hawaiian Breeze", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
