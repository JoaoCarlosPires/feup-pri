The rocket heads straight for him and lands on Mars. The only occupant is Bugs Bunny, lured into Cape Canaveral by a carrot and sent to Mars as an expendable \"astro-rabbit\". Bugs is to claim Mars in the name of the Earth, but Marvin won't allow an Earth creature to contaminate his atmosphere. He trains a time-projector gun on Bugs and reverts the bunny to a Neanderthal Rabbit, who crushes Marvin with one hand.", "popularity": 2.507, "poster_path": "/h8Uvt6H75vOYBAdgfvVA7jO9RxZ.jpg", "release_date": "1963-10-19", "title": "Mad as a Mars Hare", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 30}
