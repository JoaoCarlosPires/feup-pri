Meanwhile, two elephant children are having fun at a watering hole and a monkey barber has his barber pole eaten by a hippo, who mistakes it for a candy cane. Julius tries to remedy the latter injustice by starching up a tiger's striped tail and knocking it off, using it as a replacement pole. Alice hunts a lion who proves to be too much for her to handle, but Julius bravely comes to the rescue.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/nBThAt8GBPWmMuTboYrtglRI0cp.jpg", "release_date": "1925-01-01", "title": "Alice in the Jungle", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 6}
