They encounter Sylvester and chase him into a junkyard, where a black panther that escaped from a zoo just happens to be hiding out. Every time Spike goes into the junkyard to thrash Sylvester, he is clawed into pieces by the panther, which he, in a dark maze of crates, thinks is Sylvester. Chester has no problem pummelling Sylvester before Spike's eyes, which convinces Spike that Chester must be tougher than him.", "popularity": 0.84, "poster_path": "/122Y2dKviRzPGcCT82aukOgUXDX.jpg", "release_date": "1952-10-03", "title": "Tree for Two", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 9}
