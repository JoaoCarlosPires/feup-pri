The principal characters are spooks, ghosts, bats, bells, and, at the end, the sun. As midnight strikes, 12 spooks appear, then two ghosts. They move to the music's rhythm. Against the black night, they are blue and yellow. Bats appear as does a xylophone of bones. Mist rises, spooks swirl. A bell tolls. The sky turns light blue, the ghosts' dance slows. Then black night returns bringing intimations of frenzy. Bones play snare drums; spooks peek out of square graves. Scary faces appear. Frenetic movement takes over. A rooster crows and all return to earth as the sun's light appears.", "popularity": 1.366, "poster_path": "/m11ZsghEUooYPHQZQIBDzEatSAc.jpg", "release_date": "1940-01-01", "title": "Spook Sport", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 15}
