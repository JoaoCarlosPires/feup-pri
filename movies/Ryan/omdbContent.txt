Chris shows us clips of \"Walking\" and \"Street Musique,\" Ryan's ground-breaking shorts. We now see Ryan as he is: emaciated, alcoholic, much of his mind gone; we meet Felicity Fanjoy, his love during his creative period, and Derek Lamb, his producer. Ryan talks to Chris in the dining hall of what is probably a homeless shelter or soup kitchen. Chris tries an intervention. We follow Ryan out into the street where he panhandles. The animation, which uses live footage, reveals the ravaged burned-out graceful man.", "Language": "English, French", "Country": "Canada", "Awards": "Won 1 Oscar. 27 wins & 2 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3NWRkNTAtYzdmMy00MWUxLWEyZTMtNjc4ZGI4MzdkNWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk1MDY0MTc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.5", "imdbVotes": "2,831", "imdbID": "tt0414469", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
