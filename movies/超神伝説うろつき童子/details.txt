Two other races exist in this world: the Makai (a demon race) and the Juujinkai (a half-man, half-beast race).

But now, Amano\u00f9along with his sister Megumi and their sidekick Kuroko\u00f9must protect Nagumo and his new girlfriend Akemi Ito from the Makai, who believe that Nagumo is not the Choujin, but an evil entity bent on destroying all living beings on Earth.", "popularity": 7.102, "poster_path": "/pSfs6vqueLteWisw0wTAQCA49Ll.jpg", "release_date": "1989-03-18", "title": "Urotsukid\u014dji: Legend of the Overfiend", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 61}
