The final story is \"Taarna\", where the Loc-Nar has to come to a future Earth and changes a peaceful people into a horde of murderous barbarians who rampage with genocidal zeal. Only the last Tarrakian, a silent warrior woman known as Taarna, can avenge the victims and stop the Loc-Nar.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Canada, United Kingdom", "Awards": "4 wins & 2 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTc2NzM1ODgtM2RkYi00M2U4LWE4NzEtMDMzZGUzYmI1ZDUzL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.7/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "61%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "51/100"}], "Metascore": "51", "imdbRating": "6.7", "imdbVotes": "33,523", "imdbID": "tt0082509", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "29 Nov 2001", "BoxOffice": "$546,545", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
