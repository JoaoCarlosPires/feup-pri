The wife replies by telling of a typical day plagued by a troublesome vacuum cleaner, a long wait in a bank, bulk purchases at a department store, and a parking ticket imposed after city workers suddenly installed a fire hydrant next to the space where she had parked. When her husband refuses to be sympathetic about her long and difficult day, she takes a rolling pin and gives him a swift whack on his head.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ4ODEwNTEtZDMwOS00YzM3LWJkNDEtM2YyNDhlOWE0M2QwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5MzExNDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "264", "imdbID": "tt0047678", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
