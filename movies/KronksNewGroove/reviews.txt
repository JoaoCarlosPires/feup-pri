"Obviously not as good as its predecessor, but I had a fun time with <em>'Kronk\u2019s New Groove'</em>.\r\n\r\nLike with <em>'The Emperor\u2019s New Groove'</em>, all the goodness comes with the humour which is again amusing. David Spade (Kuzco), who only appears for short cameos here, is definitely missed but Patrick Warburton (Kronk) does a respectable job at leading this sequel.\r\n\r\nThe premise isn't as memorable as the 2000 production's, with them deciding to split a few flashback stories across the relatively short run time. I'm not usually a fan of doing that (see: <em>'Tarzan & Jane'</em>), but Elliot M. Bour, Saul Andrew Blinkoff & co. do well to keep things interesting. The format probably works better for these films due to them not taking themselves too seriously; which is a positive.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to hear the return of Warburton, Spade, John Goodman (Pacha) and others - I'm likely to enjoy a follow-up film more if the same cast remain, changes almost always end up in failure. Tracey Ullman is one of a couple newcomers to this, she's alright as Miss Birdwell.\r\n\r\nSure, this isn't something that needed to be made. However, it is a sequel that is actually fairly entertaining - which isn't always the case, especially with Disney's animated films. Worth a watch.""\n"
