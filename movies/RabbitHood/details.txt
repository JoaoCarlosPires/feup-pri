The royal grounds are, in fact, amply posted with \"No Poaching\" signs (one reads \"Not even an egg\"), but Bugs either didn't see or ignored them.

In the end, the merriest of merry men does appear and it's...it's...oh, see it yourself. Bugs goes in disguise as the King, who then knights the Sheriff (\"Arise, Sir Loin of Beef...\").", "popularity": 3.238, "poster_path": "/7bakgJ1s0wfRZVHeyesq3bqlirB.jpg", "release_date": "1949-12-24", "title": "Rabbit Hood", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 44}
