A microphone for the radio station KFWB drops in front of four of them. They snap to and burst into song (with a nap during the commercial). They sing of the joy of shooting McCoys. The McCoys, called skunks by a young boy with a deep voice, shoot their question at the Weavers: \"Do ya mean it?\" The reply: \"Yas we mean it!\" The feud is on. Coming on a scooter is \"Elmer Fudd, Peacemaker\" (though the character design and voice is that of Egghead). He suggests peace to the Weavers, and gets a backside of buckshot. The McCoys give him the same response. The sheriff catches one combatant off-side and gives him a 5 yard penalty. Elmer stands in the middle and again pleads for peace. Everyone gangs up around him; there's a huge brawl, and only Elmer is left standing.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "88", "imdbID": "tt0030129", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
