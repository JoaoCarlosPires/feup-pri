{"Title": "Xi Yang Yang Yu Hui Tai Lang Zhi Hu Hu Sheng Wei", "Year": "2010", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "29 Jan 2010", "Runtime": "88 min", "Genre": "Animation", "Director": "Sung Pong Choo", "Writer": "Alice Mak", "Actors": "Liqing Zu, Yuting Deng, Ying Liang", "Plot": "I love this movie so much, but I preferred the 4th movie more!!!\"Anyway, I Like the part where Hui Tai Lang's \"Arabian Outfit\" and Xi Yang Yang's unexpected trip with Hui Tai Lang to Egypt reminds of Disney's Aladdin movie from 1992, including the thirsty sun drinking the water. ROFL. Also, I enjoyed the part where Xiao Hui Hui finally bonds with Lan Yang Yang as \"Brothers\" for the first time ever (In the first Pleasant Goat movie in 2009, He didn't bond with Lan Yang Yang yet at the time &amp; A little like Ariel &amp; Eric from Disney's The Little Mermaid movie from 1989.).It's also about The Goats and Wolves go to and work at a Tiger-themed Theme Park (It's a little like Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955.).And that's pretty much it, Maybe you should watch this If you like Disney's The Lion King, Aladdin, &amp; Other Disney movies you can think of.
