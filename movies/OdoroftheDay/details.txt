But he has a stinky rival for occupancy of the cabin - a skunk, (but not Pepe Le Pew). The dog and skunk do battle by spraying each other with scents, Pepe with his foul odor, and the dog with perfume. Both run outside and dive into a frozen lake to remove the smells, and both catch a cold in the process. The sneezing dog and skunk then decide to share the bed in the cabin. However, it led to Pepe Le Pew's creation.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/1D2VkWRuwcXNrGxiKcN0vAJzfN3.jpg", "release_date": "1948-10-01", "title": "Odor of the Day", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 10}
