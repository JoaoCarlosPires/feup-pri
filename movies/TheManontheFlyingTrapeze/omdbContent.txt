Olive's mother delivers the sad news that Popeye's girl has run off with a \"daring young man on the flying trapeze.\" Three boys, who worship the pop-eyed sailor as a hero, try to cheer him up, but it does no good. Popeye takes the boys and their cat to the circus, where he watches not only this daring young man perform, but also Olive Oyl herself. It seems she did more than run off with him; she became part of the act. She's clearly unhappy in her new role.
