Nine minutes of animated math&gt; equations, which are interesting, perhaps even intriguing for math \"afficionados\", in their computations (all numbers and their calculations equal the numbers on either side of the \"=\" sign), move along with a semblance of life (i.e., a number \"3\" dances over to a number \"5\"), but not enough to garner any real \"love\" for any of the numerical characters.  The setting remains that of an unmoving page, only the stark, white equations shift and transform before the viewer.  The result is a painfully stagnant and utterly boring exercise, in both animation and filmmaking, by an otherwise brilliant and accomplished team (McLaren and Lambert).  Fortunately, both animators would rise above this with their subsequent endeavors. 3/10.
