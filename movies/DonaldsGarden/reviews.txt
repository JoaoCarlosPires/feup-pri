"**This is the Worst Donald Duck cartoon ever.**\r\n\r\nAs you know I'm a big fan of Donald Duck cartoons. If there's one Disney cartoon I would like to forget, it's Donald's Garden 1942.\r\n\r\nSeriously Donald Duck gets attacked by the annoying gopher who outsmarts him and literally ties him down with watermelon vines and then binge eats his entire garden and it ends on a cliffhanger which made me mad. This cartoon is very insensitive for people with eating disorders.\r\n\r\nThis is the worst Disney cartoon short I've ever seen. Donald Duck should've been the one who wins not that annoying gopher bully who I hate in the cartoon.\r\n\r\nThis cartoon deserves a Razzie award for worst cartoon short of all time right next to Uncle Donalds Ants. Do yourself a favor and skip this crummy Donald Duck cartoon short and watch The Clock Watcher 1945 instead and forget this cartoon was ever made, I hope this doesn't end up on Disney+ which I refuse to watch.""\n"
