"A few steps down from the original, <em>'Stitch! The Movie'</em> is too short to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAt just 60 minutes it doesn't do enough, so everything it shows simply falls flat. Less heart, not as funny and nowhere near as interesting. It's obvious, especially with the ending, that this only exists to kick off the television series; as opposed to building on the 2002 film.\r\n\r\nThe cast pleasingly remains the same but their performances aren't as memorable as before. Most of the characters are shoehorned in, especially Bubbles (Ving Rhames) and Capt. Gantu (Kevin Michael Richardson). Jeff Bennett comes in to voice Dr. H\u00e4msterviel, a new character, who is alright.\r\n\r\nForgettable in every way unfortunately. Still one of the better Disney animated sequels, mind.""\n"
