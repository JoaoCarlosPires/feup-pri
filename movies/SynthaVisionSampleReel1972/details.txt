This demo sampler was directed by golden age animator Jack Zander and designed by Joanne Mitchell, and showcases the technology and its capabilities through short segments of experimental animation and colorful compositions.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/usuBi8CDmgaaWJdSJwUYLkthAxs.jpg", "release_date": "1972-07-01", "title": "SynthaVision Sample Reel 1972", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
