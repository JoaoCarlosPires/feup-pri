Gerdt. Ancient history is described in great detail and exciting. In the graphic decision, artists were guided by the ancient Greek monuments, first of all - vase paintings, stylized for them and characters, and decorations, up to imitation cracks. In the film there are a lot of full-scale shots, and in particular it is interesting to frame the photographs of the bas-reliefs of the Pergamon altar shot by Yuriy Norshtein. The film ends with documentary shots of the opening of the Olympics-80 in Moscow.", "popularity": 0.84, "poster_path": "/eObNlMTxEuFiKTE2fsBRknvBkrc.jpg", "release_date": "1982-02-09", "title": "Olympians", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
