Having drifted through space for millennia, the Sidonia found itself once more under attack from Gauna for the first time in a century.  Once again facing the threat of extinction, a temporary victory against the Gauna was eked out thanks to the human-Gauna hybrid Tsumugi Shiraui and ace Guardian mech pilot Nagate Tanikaze.  10 years later... The people of Sidonia enjoy a brief respite. Peaceful days pass, during which Tsumugi begins to realize her feelings for Nagate, who is now celebrated as a hero of Sidonia. However, as Captain Kobayashi has always known, as long as the Gauna remain, peace cannot last.  The decision is made: a final battle, upon which rests the fate of humanity's last survivors. As the end approaches, will the crew be able to protect those they love?", "popularity": 1.793, "poster_path": "/pFLTKXZLvG6mvZEZEUqNYiXBL09.jpg", "release_date": "2021-06-04", "title": "Knights of Sidonia: Love Woven in the Stars", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
