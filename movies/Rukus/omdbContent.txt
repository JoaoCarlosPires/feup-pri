Rukus is a 20-year-old furry artist, living with his boyfriend Sable in the suburbs of Orlando, Florida. In his sketchbooks, Rukus is constructing an imaginary universe - a sprawling graphic novel in which painful childhood memories are restaged as an epic fantasy. Brett is a 16-year-old filmmaker with OCD, working on a documentary about kinky subcultures in spite of his own anxiety. After an interview leads to an online friendship, their lives entwine in ways that push them into strange, unexplored territories.", "Language": "N/A", "Country": "N/A", "Awards": "2 wins & 1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxYjA0YjYtNmIzNS00MGRjLWJmZDktMzJmZWNlOGUwODhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDc1NTA1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "13", "imdbID": "tt7984840", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
