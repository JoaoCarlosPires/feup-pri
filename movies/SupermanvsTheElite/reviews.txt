"One of the better Superman releases I've seen. Surprised to see The Elite in a movie, even an animated one, but they were great. Maybe in terms of the morality it explores, _Superman vs. The Elite_ and I are not always on the same page, but at least it bothers to explore it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._""\n"
