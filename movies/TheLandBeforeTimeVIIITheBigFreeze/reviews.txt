"\"You know how everybody loves Cera so much because of how she's so needlessly cruel to her friends all the time? What if we just had more and more of the characters behave in the exact same way apropos of nothing!\"\r\n\r\nThe only _Land Before Time_ thus far I couldn't stay awake through.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._""\n"
