"Certainly not as good as the first one, but to be fair, that came completely out of left field, with _The Second Part_ there was actually some degree of expectation. Very much a kids' film, but there's still a little bit of that broader appeal and deeper meaning that was found in the first one. Amazing from what amounts to a 107 minute ad for branded plastic blocks.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._""\n"
