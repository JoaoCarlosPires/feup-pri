When he's 14, he finds his father's portal and decides to go after his dad. He emerges on a strange alien planet of giants, who follow a code of honor similar to Earth's medieval chivalry. Jac meets some friendly locals and finds out that his father is still alive, but imprisoned. The aliens make no distinction between technology and magic, so Jac plans to use this to rescue his dad.
