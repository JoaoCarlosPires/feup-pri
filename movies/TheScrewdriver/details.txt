He's practically asking for trouble when he confronts a traffic cop who explains he is looking for speeders. Woody reveals himself to be a speeder by driving to Alaska and back in less than a minute. The cop tries to arrest him but Woody states, \"I bet ya wouldn't be so tough without that uniform.\" The officer undresses but Woody attacks him with a boxing glove camera. Woody also gets his goat by dressing as a farmer on horse-and-buggy and as a Chinaboy with rickshaw. Finally, the cop flips out and is sent to a mental hospital with Woody as his caretaker.", "popularity": 1.273, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1941-08-10", "title": "The Screwdriver", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.1, "vote_count": 5}
