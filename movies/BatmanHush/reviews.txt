"It's been a while since DC has brought out something that's better than passing grade, but _Hush_ was honestly kind of great. Even with the pretty massive deviation from the source material.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._""\n""Okay DC animated movie that has its moments, and nice animation, but as a fan of the original graphic novel, was a little disappointed, though not entirely surprised they went the route they did considering how much back story was involved with the source material, so changes had to be made. Still, was entertaining enough but not top tier amongst the DC Animated Universe.""\n"
