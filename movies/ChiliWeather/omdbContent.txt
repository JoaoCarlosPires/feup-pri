Speedy gets some cheese, but when he goes back, Sylvester starts chasing him. They end up on a conveyor belt, where Sylvester gets shaved by some chopping blades. Speedy spreads some grease on a platform, and Sylvester skids into a vat of Tabasco Sauce. He melts a block of ice to recover. On another conveyor belt, Sylvester gets a bottle cap on his head. He pries it off, but Speedy \"yee-ha's\" him into the ceiling where it gets stuck again, and Speedy hides his bottle opener. Sylvester wanders off, into a dehydrator, where he emerges much smaller than Speedy and runs away in fright.
