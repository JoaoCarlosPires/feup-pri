Luckily, Prof. Grampy, who also lives in the building, hears Junior's temper tantrum and puts on his thinking cap. Moments later, the light bulb on the cap goes off, and Grampy has it! With his usual knack for on-the-spot inventions, he creates carnival games and carnival rides out of everyday objects, such as a seltzer bottle, a washtub, a trashcan, a table top and so on. The best is yet to come when Grampy turns the fire escapes around the building into a roller coaster.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyMzcxNDkxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA0NjUyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "119", "imdbID": "tt0027691", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
