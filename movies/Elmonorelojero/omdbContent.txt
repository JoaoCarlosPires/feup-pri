{"Title": "El mono relojero", "Year": "1938", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "N/A", "Runtime": "N/A", "Genre": "Short, Animation", "Director": "Quirino Cristiani", "Writer": "Constancio C. Vigil, Eleazar Maestre", "Actors": "Pepe Iglesias", "Plot": "Just discovered at Cartoon Brew as linked from YouTube this animated short from Argentina-El Mono Relojero (The Clockmaking Monkey)-which is the only surviving work of one Quirino Cristiani since the rest of them were perished in a fire in 1962. Among them were the first animated feature-El Apostol (1917) and the first one in sound-Peluolopolis (1931). As his only surviving work, this short's print was a bit faded with the colors looking washed out. There's some interesting movement of the monkey going outside of his house and getting chased by some animals like the rhinoceros and the elephant. Inside, there's a bird in a cage and another one in a cuckoo clock. Their mating results in a gag that you'll probably guess here. Other than those scenes and a few more with faces being put on other clocks, this wasn't a very distinguishing cartoon. Still, it's worth a look for watching the only surviving animation from Mr. Cristiani since he once showed this and his others for Walt Disney himself. P.S. One of the voices is that of Pepe Iglesias who dubbed the fox in Disney's Pinocchio in Spanish.", "Language": "Spanish", "Country": "Argentina", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.2", "imdbVotes": "35", "imdbID": "tt0196763", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
