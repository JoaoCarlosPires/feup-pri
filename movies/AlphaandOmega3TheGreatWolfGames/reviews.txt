Humphrey really shows he's a great coach and a loving dad, the puppies are cuter than ever, Marcel and Paddy are still hilarious and the new puppy Fleet, he was also great. and we also get Kate too. now, i was a little bit sad that there wasn't a lotta Kate moments in the movie. she's only in the movie for like the last half. but like always, Kate steals the show! the moments with her in the movie gotta be some of the best moments i seen in any movie so far. Kate never fails to bring a big smile on your face. she's still hot and sexy without a doubt (hey, she'll always be like that), but she also proves that she's a fantastic mom. the first time we see Kate in the movie (spoiler alert! again stop reading if you haven't seen it yet) is in a flashback Claudette has where she's teaching her the slide. this scene was just so adorable, i never stop smiling. and it's proof that Kate's the best character in this awesome saga and she'll always be. the bummer of this movie, it's that the story wasn't that strong. it's like Tom Kane was like \"Sorry, i can't think of a better story now, so here ya go: The Great Wolf Games\" what? Tom Kane, you can do better. i know you can. also half of the main characters aren't in this movie. i totally get the fact that Kate came earlier from the hunting trip, but i would've loved to seen them at the end. that never happened in this movie, so yea it was kinda of a let down.\r\nall that aside, Alpha and Omega 3 is still a awesome movie and i love it.", "created_at": "2014-06-27T19:57:36.451Z", "id": "53adccb0c3a3682ed8001e20", "updated_at": "2021-06-23T15:57:27.010Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/53adccb0c3a3682ed8001e20"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}
