"Maybe it's just nostalgia that makes me love _The Land Before Time_, but I'm pretty sure the beautiful scenery at least does hold up. And that theme music, oh my God, right in the chest... That might be nostalgia again... \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._""\n"
