He plummets to the sidewalk below, losing one of his nine \"lives\"; the spirit descends into Hell, where the puddy tat meets up with a Satanic bulldog. There, the bulldog encourages Sylvester to risk his remaining eight \"lives\" chasing the bird in the most dangerous of situations. Sylvester loses his second \"life\" when crushed beneath a steamroller; his third frightened after realizing he chased Tweety into a carnival tunnel (that had a lion's mouth opening); \"lives\" four through seven while on a shooting gallery; and his eighth just after grabbing the bird on a speeding roller coaster car. The Satanic bulldog reappears and demands Sylvester \"go get him\"; the puddy tat resists temptation and takes refuge in a seemingly safe bank vault.
