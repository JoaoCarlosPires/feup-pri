"Definitively better than <em>'Stitch! The Movie'</em>, though <em>'Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch'</em> is still a pretty disappointing sequel.\r\n\r\nThe premise is uneven, everything involving Stitch and his glitch is actually quite good. However, they drag that out in order to add some stuff with Nani/David and Lilo herself, all of which isn't at all interesting; though there is, at least, a bit of heart in the way Lilo's storyline ends.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Lilo, Dakota Fanning replaces Daveigh Chase in the role. Fanning is solid if a little more wooden, Chase's voice feels more natural. Chris Sanders gives an amusing performance as Stitch, while none of the others stand out all that much.\r\n\r\nStill way inferior to 2002's <em>'Lilo & Stitch'</em>, but thankfully it doesn't turn into pure toilet viewing like many other straight-to-video sequels from this studio.""\n"
