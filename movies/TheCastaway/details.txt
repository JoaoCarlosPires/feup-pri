He then discovers a piano that washed ashore, and begins playing it. The animals come around; a gorilla, after playing a 4-hands piece with his feet, destroys the piano. Mickey runs away and accidentally wakes a lion. The lion chases Mickey to a stream, where he jumps onto a rock that turns out to be right next to a crocodile.", "popularity": 3.345, "poster_path": "/uvEjqk1lXDUstu6v9g8c0JfaAxQ.jpg", "release_date": "1931-04-05", "title": "The Castaway", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 18}
