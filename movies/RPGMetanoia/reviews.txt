"All I can say is, WOW! Amazing! A Quality Movie! The Kids Loved it! I Enjoyed it! I'll definitely buy the Original DVD once it comes out! This is will be a collectors item! I Highly recommend it parents who's kids are stuck in front of the computer! It's really worth the time watching it! More Power to the Makers of this Film, please, make more movies like this one! This is a history in the Philippine Movie Industry. The First Full Length CG Animated Filipino Movie! I'd like to see this movie again and again! The story is really outstanding! I loved the concept of the story. It's got a very excellent Moral Lesson. Take your kids to watch it. WOW!""\n"
