Despite living in one house, they exchanged letters. The first one was written in 1994, the last one 15 years later. In these letters, the women share their deepest feelings and insecurities. This autobiographical essay also takes the form of a letter. Its author revives the lively letter exchange through videos recorded on her mobile phone and her own animations. It is not only a dialogue of the women in the family, but also of the past and the present, of people and their images.", "popularity": 1.773, "poster_path": "/aVgaIMV85yuTmKD7qpNDfR1ekh5.jpg", "release_date": "2021-10-28", "title": "Remember to Kiss Me When You Wake Up", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
