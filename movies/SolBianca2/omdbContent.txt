Small problem: they're not the only space pirates after the stuff. But, no big deal--they'll just burgle the burglars. That works out fine, except that the captain of the other ship doesn't take his defeat lightly and manages to infect the Sol Bianca with some machine-eating worms before getting arrested. Now they're stuck in jumpspace, and worse yet for the five, June is as sick as the ship and they don't even know what's wrong with her. By the time the crew figures out why nothing works, the police have shown up and the only plan they manage to come up with is to have Feb and April surrender and wait for the ship to recover. There's also a mysterious fellow who is not only trying to corner the market on Pasha, but seems to know all about the Sol Bianca and her crew--and he wants the captured pair transferred into his custody immediately. Meanwhile, Janny and May are trying to take care of June, who still hasn't recovered, and they don't even have a working ship to rescue their comrades with. Then there's that pirate fellow, who has escape plans of his own... and a serious grudge against the Sol Bianca and her crew.", "Language": "Japanese", "Country": "Japan", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE5Njg4ODg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM5ODQ5._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.1", "imdbVotes": "78", "imdbID": "tt0102954", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "11 Jul 1995", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
