This time they arrange a world cup with 4 teams: Japan, USA, \"All Europe\", and \"All South America\". In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America. In the final round S.A. shows their \"soccer cyborg\" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable. All their classical tricks like Hyugas \"Tiger Shot\" or Tsubasas \"Top Spin\" seem to be totally worthless, but in a hard and spectacular match the Japanese learn more and more to play in unison and finally they get the win.", "popularity": 4.754, "poster_path": "/e35mPWMaR3MNKKQ3jXzdXLQD6S1.jpg", "release_date": "1986-07-11", "title": "Captain Tsubasa Movie 04: The great world competition The Junior World Cup", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 33}
