The film also showcases Sergei Yuktevich's fondness for formal experimentation. It is nominally adapted from Mayakovsky's play \"The Bedbug\" and his screenplay \"Forget All About the Fireplace.\"", "popularity": 1.503, "poster_path": "/gelWZvYQeJMzEVki1Dj201pWhMR.jpg", "release_date": "1976-10-25", "title": "Mayakovsky Laughs", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 1}
