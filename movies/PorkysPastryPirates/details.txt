A hungry fly stares in through the window, as a bee shows up and tells him he should just go for it. The bee enters and at first intimidates Porky; when Porky finally gets angry enough to try swatting the bee, the bee electrifies the flyswatter. The bee then coaches the fly: with a little help from the trash bin, the fly is soon disguised as a bee himself. But the costume falls off the first time the fly faces Porky, and the fly finds himself on the wrong end of the swatter. The bee returns for a dinner snack, only to find the angry fly wielding the swatter.", "popularity": 1.68, "poster_path": "/9oMMgNvOt5qVQW4oSGHIXBUvwov.jpg", "release_date": "1942-01-17", "title": "Porky's Pastry Pirates", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 8}
