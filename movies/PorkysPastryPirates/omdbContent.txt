A hungry fly stares in through the window, as a bee shows up and tells him he should just go for it. The bee enters and at first intimidates Porky; when Porky finally gets angry enough to try swatting the bee, the bee electrifies the flyswatter. The bee then coaches the fly: with a little help from the trash bin, the fly is soon disguised as a bee himself. But the costume falls off the first time the fly faces Porky, and the fly finds himself on the wrong end of the swatter. The bee returns for a dinner snack, only to find the angry fly wielding the swatter.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y1MDgwNjgtZWM4YS00ZmEzLWExNDgtMjc1NTFiNzk0YjJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI4ODc2NDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.1", "imdbVotes": "163", "imdbID": "tt0035203", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
