The disc includes three stories to keep kids entertained as they learn about values such as cooperation and improve their problem solving skills. Mo Willems is a great children\u2019s book author, so any issues with the release don\u2019t stem from his work, but rather from the price for a single DVD release with only three stories when Scholastic will inevitably be releasing them as part of a larger set down the road (if they haven\u2019t already) for a better value.", "popularity": 1.797, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "2010-12-31", "title": "The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
