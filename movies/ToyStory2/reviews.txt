"When I was a kid, I remember thinking that _Toy Story 2_ was pretty good, but nothing on the original. Over the years, I've known many, many, many people, and seen a great number more online, who are of the opinion that this second entry is not only better than its predecessor, but that it went on to stay the best film in the (now 4 movie strong) series. I always sorta figured, that when I grew up and rewatched it, I'd reach the same conclusion, so, uh, nope. Basically. That never happened. _Toy Story 2_ is pretty good, but nothing on the original.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._""\n""One of the greatest sequels around. <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>, whilst marginally inferior, still manages to create the same magic that the original has - which is mightily impressive.\r\n\r\nIt, at least to me, has less humour but what it loses there it makes up for in the premise, which is arguably more interesting when compared to the 1995 film. I very much enjoy it, especially the location of the finale.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks is again fabulous as Woody, while Tim Allen (Buzz) & Co. remain as entertaining as before. They also introduce some cool new characters, with the standout being Jessie who is voiced astutely by Joan Cusack; Jessie's backstory is so well done. Al (Wayne Knight) and Pete (Kelsey Grammer) are good additions, too.\r\n\r\nThere are some tremendous scenes here, that one for Cusack's character and the conclusion are my favourites alongside the ultra satisfying restoration scene; the end credits are amusing, also. It's all fun.\r\n\r\nThe other two sequels are brilliant, but this is the pick of the three. I'd highly recommend, evidently.""\n"
