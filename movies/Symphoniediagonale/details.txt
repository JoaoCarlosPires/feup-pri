The figure vanishes and the process begins again with a new pattern, each cycle lasting one or two seconds. The complete figures are drawn in a vaguely Art Deco style and could be said to resemble any number of things, an ear, a harp, panpipes, a grand piano with trombones, and so on, only highly stylized. The tone is playful and hypnotic.", "popularity": 2.722, "poster_path": "/x2sKH9OAWCkP8PTYDOGXH6QXFGK.jpg", "release_date": "1924-11-04", "title": "Diagonal Symphony", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 45}
