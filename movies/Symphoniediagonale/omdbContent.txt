The figure vanishes and the process begins again with a new pattern, each cycle lasting one or two seconds. The complete figures are drawn in a vaguely Art Deco style and could be said to resemble any number of things, an ear, a harp, panpipes, a grand piano with trombones, and so on, only highly stylized. The tone is playful and hypnotic.", "Language": "None", "Country": "Germany", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWEwMjY3ZWItYzg1Zi00NmRkLWEwOGYtNGMzYjk4NjJjZTQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ5MjE2ODI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.0", "imdbVotes": "1,348", "imdbID": "tt0015384", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
