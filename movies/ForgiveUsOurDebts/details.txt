Jesus teaches that forgiveness comes from God as He instructs Peter to catch a fish that contains a coin to pay Peter's debt. Jesus also teaches about a man who is forgiven by his king of an enormous debt. Yet, the forgiven man leaves and immediately casts a man, who owes him almost nothing, into prison. The king then rescinds his forgiveness. To receive forgiveness we must also forgive.", "popularity": 1.09, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1991-01-01", "title": "Forgive Us Our Debts", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
