The eccentric gentlemen come in all shapes and sizes, the fat ones putting the greatest strain on the horses. The craziest things happen to the monocled hunters. One even gets knocked off his horse when it jumps over a brick wall. He shoots straight up into the air and, thanks to a parachute hidden in his clothes, makes a gentle landing. But instead of the ground, he lands on a cow. Upset by her unwanted passenger, she takes off at top speed, finally dumping him in a mud puddle, where he lands on a pig and continues his wacky ride. Meanwhile, the poor fox finally gets trapped in a hollow log. Dogs to the left of him, dogs to the right! Luckily, the beleaguered creature gets help from a certain powerful, and pungent, friend.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAzMmMzMzgtMjQ4Mi00MmQ2LWEwN2UtYzJlMTViYzc1YTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxODMyODU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.8", "imdbVotes": "211", "imdbID": "tt0021883", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
