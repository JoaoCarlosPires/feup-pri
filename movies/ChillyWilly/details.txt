A small penguin, Chilly Willy (the only penguin not equipped for cold weather...anywhere), sees the ship and tries to get warm by its stove. The watchdog attempts to get rid of him, but Willy manages to get the dog drunk from the rum in its own cask. The captain returns to find Willy saving the ship from sinking, while the dog is found sleeping it off. Willy is made mascot and the dog is tossed in the ship's brig.", "popularity": 1.081, "poster_path": "/d75rnCxuT4vKPX9UHRQgzavSQf8.jpg", "release_date": "1953-12-20", "title": "Chilly Willy", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 7}
