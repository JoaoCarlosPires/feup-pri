{"Title": "Hollywood Canine Canteen", "Year": "1946", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "20 Apr 1946", "Runtime": "7 min", "Genre": "Family, Animation, Short", "Director": "Robert McKimson", "Writer": "Warren Foster", "Actors": "Bea Benaderet, Sara Berner, Richard Bickenbach", "Plot": "A group of celebrity dogs, led by an 'Edward G. Robinson' look-alike and including 'Jimmy Durante', decide that celebrity dogs need a nightclub of their own. What follows is very similar to Hollywood Steps Out (1941), except that all the celebrities are drawn as dogs. Notable gags: Dogwood &amp; Blondie making a sandwich of bones; Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy washing dishes, with Stan putting the washed dishes back into the sink; Bud Abbott and 'Lou Costello' as dogs; a sheepdog with hair in his eyes who suddenly has perfect vision when a pretty girl walks by. In an extended scene, Leopold Bowowsky conducts an orchestra; after a series of spot gags, a tuba player misses his cue because he was getting a cup of water, then blows the wrong note because of a fly on his score. Bing Crosby, who was earlier greeting patrons, loses a girl to Frank Sinatra, who was hiding behind a pencil-thin tree. Kaynine Kyser leads his band; we see quick solos from several jazz players, like \"Hairy\" James and \"Boney\" Goodman. Finally, the payoff of a running gag: a soldier who had been waiting to call home to Massachusetts gets to use a megaphone with that state's name on it.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjdiNTNiZTQtNDFlOC00MDliLWI2OTktM2IzN2U5ZjA3ZTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzExMDg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "199", "imdbID": "tt0038607", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
