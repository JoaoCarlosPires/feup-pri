"Overall Grade:  3.1/5\r\nLetter Grade: B-\r\nStar Grade: 2.5/5, 5/10\r\n\r\nI bought this movie, excited to finally see \"A Death in the Family\" in animated form.  DC has rarely disappointed me with their movies, but I have to say... this one was a humongous disappointment.  I mean, this movie sucked.  It was nothing but a 30 minute recap of \"Under the Red Hood\" with a little bit of \"Death in the Family\" thrown in at the beginning, followed by 4 DC Showcase movies I didn't give a crap about.\r\n\r\nThe only reason for as high a grade as it gets is because of the animation and voice acting.  Otherwise, total waste of time.  And the digital version doesn't even give you the interactive capabilities, meaning you're losing stuff that the blu-ray has.  \r\n\r\nI want my money back, DC, and I've never said that about your movies before.""\n"
