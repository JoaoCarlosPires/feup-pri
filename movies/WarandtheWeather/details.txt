Just like rivers that move water around on the land, atmospheric rivers\u2014never visible to the naked eye\u2014were a vital force in shaping the colonization of the American West. Today, the evolving scientific and cultural understandings of atmospheric rivers exemplify the complexity and importance of the stories we tell ourselves about science, climate, and the natural world.
