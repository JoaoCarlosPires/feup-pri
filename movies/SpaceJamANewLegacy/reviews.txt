"A very creative alternate to the original. The story line is all original and updated with current times. Lots of great puns and looney jokes. Better than what I expected. However nobody can be Michael Jordan""\n""Pros:\r\n- Kong and the Iron Giant gave eachother a fist bump!\r\n- It featured many characters from Warner Bros.\r\n- Porky Pig roasting Al-G Rhythm in a rap battle\r\n- Gabriel Iglesias and Zendaya provided the voices of Speedy Gonzales and Lola Bunny, respectively \r\n- It was better than the first film\r\n- LeBron James!\r\n- There could a be a possible Space Jam spin off titled Wonder Bunny!\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- They never showed the Pepe Le Pew scene.\r\n- I was hoping the Tune Squad would play against villains of Warner Bros.; Wicked Witch of the West, Sauron, Pennywise/It, Agent Smith...\r\n- I was expecting a surprise twist, where Al-G Rhythm turns out not to be a bad guy but was actually helping LeBron understand his son more. The writers should've done more.\r\n- Cringing moments""\n"
