"Two stories: one good, one less so.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad'</em> is another Disney package film. It's probably one of the better ones to be fair, though still fails to truly entertain. The first story featuring Mr. Toad is fairly enjoyable, while the one with Ichabod starts off solidly but by its end I found myself less interested.\r\n\r\nBing Crosby and Basil Rathbone do well as narrators, while the animation is more than passable. Again, like 1948's <em>'So Dear to My Heart'</em> from Disney, it's nothing to hate on but I wouldn't class it as anything other than average though.\r\n\r\n/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\\""\n"
