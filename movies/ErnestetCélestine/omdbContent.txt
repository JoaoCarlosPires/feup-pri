However, Celestine, an apprentice mouse dentist, finds at least momentary common cause with Ernest, a poor street Bear musician, that gets them rejected from both their respective worlds. In spite of this misfortune, the exiles find a growing friendship between themselves as their respective talents flower because of it. Despite this, their quietly profound challenge to the founding prejudices of their worlds cannot be ignored as the authorities track them down. When that happens, Ernest and Celestine must stand up for their love in the face of such bigotry and achieve the impossible.", "Language": "French, English", "Country": "France, Belgium, Luxembourg", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 14 wins & 15 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzA5ODY4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU5ODMwMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.9/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "98%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "86/100"}], "Metascore": "86", "imdbRating": "7.9", "imdbVotes": "19,626", "imdbID": "tt1816518", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$262,075", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
