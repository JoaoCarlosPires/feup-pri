"An amusing four-minute short, which serves as a prequel to <em>'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'</em>.\r\n\r\nJohn Mulaney returns to voice the titular character, to good effect - there are a couple of nice gags in there. Animation is sweet, too. It's obviously not necessary, but <em>'Spider-Ham: Caught in a Ham'</em> is good nevertheless.""\n"
