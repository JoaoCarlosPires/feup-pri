He rushes upstairs to inform his domineering wife, and she accuses him of being crazy and threatens to have him put away. He persists that he did see a unicorn in the garden, and she phones for the authorities to come take him away. But when they arrive, with strait-jackets, they find the wife rambling and raving about seeing the unicorn, and promptly take her away.", "popularity": 2.148, "poster_path": "/hsuT6j3hhRLCGc3IAepOQL5g0mn.jpg", "release_date": "1953-09-24", "title": "The Unicorn in the Garden", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 36}
