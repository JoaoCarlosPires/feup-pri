It features two of the first and greatest robots of all time,Great Mazinger and getter Robot. I first saw this when i was about 8 and i've loved it ever since. The action is brilliant and the animation is great(no CGI crap of course,just pure brilliant animation). It also features Jun and Boss Borot(which also appears in the Mazinger Z,Great Mazinger,and UFO grendizer series'). This is one of many other movies to feature Great Mazinger. Some of the others are Great Mazinger vs Grendizer, Great Mazinger vs Grendizer vs Getter Robot G, and another great movie is Mazinger Z vs Devilman, all classics. These movies are still widely available and in remastered versions on the Internet(try Ebay). 10/10", "Language": "Japanese", "Country": "Japan", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI5YzE0YjQtZjdhMC00MTZkLTg1YTAtYzg3M2U5MzMyN2ZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU1ODUxOTk@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.8", "imdbVotes": "71", "imdbID": "tt0422354", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
