I will say that it lacked in plot however. I know this was based on Crime and Punishment, but the story seems to drag on and on.He also seems to have a thing with flies, keyholes, and clocks; you'll notice if you watch his other work...All in all, pretty impressive, it's too bad that his work is so hard to get a hold of.", "Language": "None", "Country": "Poland", "Awards": "3 wins", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc4N2VjMzgtOWE3My00ZDNlLWExY2MtNTdiZWM3MjU2MWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc4MzI2NQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "225", "imdbID": "tt0290336", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
