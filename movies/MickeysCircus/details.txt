Donald has a trained sea lion act, and does a bit of juggling himself. Mostly, though, he fights with a baby sea lion who keeps stealing both the fish and the show. Donald then finds himself and Mickey in an unrehearsed high wire act, which kicks into high gear when one of the orphans electrifies the wire. They end by doing a high dive into the seals' tank.", "popularity": 3.599, "poster_path": "/dF8pSLw1jW4XzfLoiaH6vLmONeb.jpg", "release_date": "1936-08-01", "title": "Mickey's Circus", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 22}
