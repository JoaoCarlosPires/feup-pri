When he can't open a window, he flies into a rage and practically destroys her house. She won't see him again until he takes care of that temper. He orders a mail-order insult machine, which promises that if Donald can endure 10 minutes of abuse without losing his temper, he'll be cured. It proceeds to deliver physical and verbal abuse, and Donald is cured. He goes back and Daisy tests him on the balky window.", "popularity": 1.26, "poster_path": "/hWMUOSf6p8GdEzHaHK9G4oe63nj.jpg", "release_date": "1945-10-26", "title": "Cured Duck", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 16}
