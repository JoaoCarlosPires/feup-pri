She lives at home with her over-protective Chinese grandparents and has never been anywhere by herself. Once in Iran, she finds herself in the company of poets and Persians, all who tell her stories that force her to confront her past; the Iranian father she assumed abandoned her and the nature of Poetry itself. It\u2019s about building bridges between cultural and generational divides. It\u2019s about being curious. Staying open. And finding your own voice through the magic of poetry.  Rosie goes on an unwitting journey of forgiveness, reconciliation, and perhaps above all, understanding, through learning about her father\u2019s past, her own cultural identity, and her responsibility to it.", "popularity": 2.907, "poster_path": "/2AROSbxzwu9R2hPfUtZXDDz8UBj.jpg", "release_date": "2016-06-13", "title": "Window Horses: The Poetic Persian Epiphany of Rosie Ming", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 11}
