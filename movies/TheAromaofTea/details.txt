It shows how a small sphere travels in a determined and rhythmical manner through landscapes, emerging at the end into a larger sphere of white light. Both the graphic brushstroke and the music, with its haunting rhythms, are strikingly simple and direct. The theme of the film, a quest followed by a union, is as old as time and recognizable despite its limitless variations.", "popularity": 1.523, "poster_path": "/rFm4yLnrQzvcr0I8ojdE1VaEn7c.jpg", "release_date": "2006-06-01", "title": "The Aroma of Tea", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 22}
