A competition ensues with Daffy out to get the top billing he deserves to prove that he is the star of the show. However, Bugs seems to be the crowd favorite as Daffy can't seem to best him in dancing, a magic act, juggling or playing musical instruments. This pushes Daffy to extreme measures as he performs a deadly stunt in his final attempt to impress the audience. He drinks some gasoline, some nitroglycerin, some gunpowder, some Uranium-238, lights up and swallows a match, causing him to explode. The audience gives him the acclaim he deserves for his performance, but Daffy (now an angel rising to heaven) \"can only do it once\".", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTZmODFmYzEtZDU5Ni00ZDZlLWIwMjQtYzZiYmUyM2I2NmY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc2NTQzMjU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.8", "imdbVotes": "992", "imdbID": "tt0050965", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
