Against a blue background, white fireworks explode. Parts of a flag (red and white stripes and white stars on a blue background) move to the music's rhythm. The lines become hearts, circles, and stars: Cupid's arrows join the fun as do Stars of David and other rapidly moving lines. Sometimes the screen is dominated by patters of straight lines, then by squiggles and blobs. The movement of the shapes is rapid as they morph from one symbol to another. Red, white, and blue fireworks become comets, stars, and suns. A few reddish clouds appear at the finale.", "Language": "N/A", "Country": "Canada", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMDMzMzg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUwNzk1MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.2", "imdbVotes": "158", "imdbID": "tt0031977", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
