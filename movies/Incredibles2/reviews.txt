"A good sequel.\r\n\r\n<em>'Incredibles 2'</em> isn't too far away from the preceding film, which is always a big plus for a follow-up. This one is definitely the more funnier of the two, there are some very amusing moments; especially with Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile/Nick Bird).\r\n\r\nFrom a plot point of view, the antagonists are better though unfortunately they do go down the obvious direction with them. I felt a few pacing issues too, it's a slow burner. The animation is very solid, as are the voice cast.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the cast, all of the main lot return with the exception of  Spencer Fox (Dash) - whose absence I didn't really notice in truth. Everyone's as good as they are in the original, while the additions of Winston (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn (Catherine Keener) are welcomed. There's also a small yet nice role for Odenkirk's <em>'Better Call Saul'</em> co-star Jonathan Banks (Dicker).\r\n\r\nThis does some things greater than <em>'The Incredibles'</em>, but other things less so. Nevertheless, it's a very respectable Disney sequel.""\n""Doesn't hold a candle to the original _Incredibles_, and it's like... **really** on the nose, but _Incredibles 2_ is still a good time. \r\n\r\nFinal rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go.""\n"
