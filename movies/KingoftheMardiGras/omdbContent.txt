Bluto is a strongman, claiming to be King of the Mardi Gras, and drawing a large crowd. Popeye, nearby, claims only, \"I yam what I yam,\" and has no crowd, but still draws Bluto's wrath. He manages to spoil a balance trick, then tops it with Wimpy in a chair. Olive then volunteers to be levitated; Bluto pulls her over and saws her in half. Olive escapes to a roller coaster with the boys in pursuit.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1YjQzN2UtNWU1NS00ZGMwLTk3ZDctYTNmMmY5YWZmZTEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDcwNDI2MTk@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.2", "imdbVotes": "230", "imdbID": "tt0026573", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
