Bluto is a strongman, claiming to be King of the Mardi Gras, and drawing a large crowd. Popeye, nearby, claims only, \"I yam what I yam,\" and has no crowd, but still draws Bluto's wrath. He manages to spoil a balance trick, then tops it with Wimpy in a chair. Olive then volunteers to be levitated; Bluto pulls her over and saws her in half. Olive escapes to a roller coaster with the boys in pursuit.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/qEAyrS9U13eDgRy0lZOjtSEU4ON.jpg", "release_date": "1935-09-26", "title": "King of the Mardi Gras", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 3}
