"The \"Friends for Dinner\" song was honestly pretty cute. I think the first track that has grated on me in the series up to this point since _Land Before Time 2's_ egg-snatchin' song... Actually not just \"since\" that song, it literally is just those two songs I haven't groaned at. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand these are movies for kids. I watched them when I was a kid, but kids' movies can still be good to adults, and often are. This one is... more \"okay\" to adults. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._""\n"
