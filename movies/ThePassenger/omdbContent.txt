A page of a newspaper blows into his face; it's overcast and begins to rain; a dog barks viciously. He boards a bus and sits in back, puts on headphones and continues reading, noticing a goldfish in water inside a knotted plastic bag beside him. The fish proves to be no ordinary one, especially when the bookish lad turns on his tape player. As the otherwise empty bus speeds through the rain, will our worm, armed only with his umbrella, survive? Is he a quick enough learner?", "Language": "English", "Country": "Australia", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE4MjRkMjAtNDE2NC00MjZjLWE1YTgtZDdmMzg1MmQzNTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0NjA2MTc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.0", "imdbVotes": "358", "imdbID": "tt1200073", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
