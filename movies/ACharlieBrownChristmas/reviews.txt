The memory and the childish feelings I had for it are wrapped up in its value for me. For example, I am an atheist, so the nativity story doesn\u2019t carry a religious message for me, but I can appreciate its function in the story, and I read a lot of other fictional mythical origin stories without being cynical.\r\n\r\nIt is funny that our minds connect the jazz theme with Christmas, when it is, well, jazz. Also an oddity that Bill Melendez was the producer, director and voice (such as it was) for Snoopy. They used children for a lot of the voices, rather than adults simulating child voices. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to learn how children nowadays respond to seeing this old show for the first time, after being exposed to many other modern shows and animation techniques, video games, etc.", "created_at": "2020-08-26T03:54:59.102Z", "id": "5f45dd131d01910034dd7cbc", "updated_at": "2021-06-23T15:58:43.264Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f45dd131d01910034dd7cbc"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}
