When the tourists arrive, Willoughby tells the park bears they are free to take whatever food the tourists give them... all except Fatso, whom the ranger deems way too out-of-shape and instructs to diet intensely. Craving food, the bear tries to elude Willoughby and \"pig out\" but the omnipresent ranger always puts a stop to his antics. Finally, tourist season ends and Fatso, having gotten no food, is thin as a rail. Says the ranger, \"Fatso, you're a mess. Have you been dieting?\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.2", "imdbVotes": "18", "imdbID": "tt0150994", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
