They're stupid but they kinda work, at least in terms of what their intended purpose is.\r\n\r\nThe casting is quite something. Jason Lee, somewhat surprisingly, returns, with new addition Bella Thorne - who appears in, like, four scenes. You also have Christina Applegate, Anna Faris and Kaley Cuoco in voice roles, alongside appearances from \"Crazy Eyes\", \"Stifler's Mom\", \"savior Jared\" and \"Crabman\". Iykyk.\r\n\r\nI didn't care for any of it, the story is clich\u00e9d, nonsensical and woefully written - and there's barely even a road trip. I do, though, like the chipmunk animation, I chuckled a few times due to how they are animated.\r\n\r\nRubbish no doubt, yet I can't say I hate it to be honest.", "created_at": "2021-01-01T04:17:54.992Z", "id": "5feea272bd990c003f2e7bf7", "updated_at": "2021-06-23T15:58:49.510Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5feea272bd990c003f2e7bf7"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}
