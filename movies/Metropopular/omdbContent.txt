US cities are 'anthropomorphosized' (ok, that's my $100 word) and brought to life as talking heads. The animation is interesting too, a unique blend of posterization and metallic finish.  I admit to having a soft spot for this flick because it was produced in the Bay Area and used all local voice talent.  Take that, L.A.! (Of course, I see from checking IMDB that the director has moved to L.A., so there you go!)I saw it at the SF International Film Festival, and also at Spike and Mike in Berkeley. Got pretty good audience reaction both times.  Fun surprise ending. Awrighty, that's my $00.02 worth.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "1 win", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.2", "imdbVotes": "26", "imdbID": "tt0280939", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
