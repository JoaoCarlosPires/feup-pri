A few of them: a cat dancing to a cat band; a mouse poking at a (live) cat until it moves; a couple mice boxing, while the animators crowd around cheering and acting as corner-men. That night, she dreams of taking a train to cartoon-land, where a red carpet reception awaits. She appears in live action. They have a welcoming parade, with Alice riding on an elephant. The cartoons dance for her, and she dances for them. Meanwhile, the lions break out of the zoo. The lions chase her into a hollow tree, then into a cave and down a rabbit hole. Finally, she jumps off a cliff and awakes back in her bed.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzRlM2QxNGEtZjkyMS00NTExLWFmMTQtOTkwMjNhYjFjOTAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.5", "imdbVotes": "681", "imdbID": "tt0013823", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
