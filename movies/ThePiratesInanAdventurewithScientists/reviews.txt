"Given the name, it took me a long time to understand that this wasn't a sequel to something. But I watched it anyway, because I was short on 2012 movies for my best to worst list. _Adventure with Scientists!_ will probably end up somewhere around the middle of that list.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._""\n""A rediculously fun animated film for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nPirates! In an adventure with Scientists! has an amazing cast with humorous moments and of course, the beards!\r\nHugh Grant is just funny, and the same goes for this film!""\n"
