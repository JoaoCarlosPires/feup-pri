His plane is vaporized in mid-air, but Bosko's fall is broken by the keys of a piano. Bombs have destroyed most of the house surrounding the piano, but the instrument itself is undamaged. Bosko meets Honey, a French girl who happens to skip by. His piano playing impresses her, but the fearsome beast interrupts his performance by dropping a bomb on him.
