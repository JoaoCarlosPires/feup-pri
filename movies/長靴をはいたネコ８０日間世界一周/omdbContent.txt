{"Title": "In 80 Betten um die Welt", "Year": "1976", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "02 Jun 1977", "Runtime": "79 min", "Genre": "Horror, Thriller", "Director": "Erwin C. Dietrich, Jes\u00fas Franco", "Writer": "Erwin C. Dietrich", "Actors": "Esther Moser, Esther Studer, Vera Chollet", "Plot": "This is an episodic erotic film mostly directed by Producer Erwin C. Dietrich. Jess Franco may have directed some brief footage, such as one scene which involves a sadistic cult and has some similarities to scenes in Franco's own EXORCISM (1974). A few of the episodes are the kind of crude, silly comedy familiar from 1960s and 70s German sex films. After a while it just gets rather tiresome. The film is very lightweight and lacks Franco's overall thematic vision and singular style.The episodes are mostly played for comedy but they're not very amusing and not very erotic. This was shot in 1976-1977, a very busy year for Jess Franco in which he made several of his better films (JACK THE RIPPER, LOVE LETTERS OF A PORTUGUESE NUN, DORIANA GRAY). It appears he just helped out producer Dietrich with a few scenes in this one. If you're a hardcore Jess Franco completest you might want to check it out, but I can't recommend it.", "Language": "German", "Country": "Switzerland", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "4.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "4.3", "imdbVotes": "67", "imdbID": "tt0178627", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
