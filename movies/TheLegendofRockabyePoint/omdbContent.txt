The captain explains how, 20 years ago, a polar bear was trying to steal fish from his ship. Alas, Chilly Willy the penguin also had his eyes on the fish. A very mean bulldog was sleeping in front of the fish, and Willy made sure the polar bear kept waking it up. Every time, the bear quickly sang a verse of \"Rockabye Baby\" and the dog would fall asleep again. Finally, the two of them ended up stranded atop a tall iceberg, where we see that they're still going at it, with bushy gray beards now.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 1 nomination total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M3MWJmNzktNDUzNi00MzQ5LTg4ZTUtM2Q5MTc1NDM3MzBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgzNzU3NTA@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.4", "imdbVotes": "356", "imdbID": "tt0048292", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
