Nobody knows where they came from or what their ultimate agenda is, but the fact remains that their attacks drove people out of their towns and cities. In order to take arms against them, humanity develops a new anti-Neuroi weapon called the \"Striker Unit.\" Using the power of magic to fight against the monsters, this new device enhances and amplifies the power of female magic-wielders.
