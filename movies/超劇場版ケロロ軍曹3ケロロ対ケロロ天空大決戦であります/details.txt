While on the exploration, Keroro accidentally sets off a trap, and by chance they find a hidden chamber with a large blue crystal in the center, on a stand that has a key in it. Keroro leans on the key, causing the room to activate a mysterious machine, this caused the entire temple to shake. As soon as the group realized what was happening, they run out of the room.

The group successfully escapes, while the girl (now sprouting a pair of glowing wings) watches them leave - while back in the chamber, something is growing within the crystal...", "popularity": 1.176, "poster_path": "/9sazhwyy5vvgFzRqZfUqtI2QpCY.jpg", "release_date": "2008-03-10", "title": "Sergeant Keroro The Super Duper Movie 3: Keroro vs. Keroro Great Sky Duel", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5}
