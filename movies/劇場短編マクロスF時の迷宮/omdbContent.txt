She's beautiful and can take a joke (though she's usually the butt of them). And she's married to a guy who must've won some sort of marriage lottery, because she looks the way she does and he's... funny. But what happens when we follow Allison out of her husband's domain? When she finally wakes up to (and revolts against) the injustices in her life? Kevin Can FK Himself breaks television convention and blends multi-camera comedy with single-camera realism to make us ask, \"who and what have we been laughing at all of these years?\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "1 win", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ2YTRhZjUtNzQ5Mi00NDg1LWEyN2QtYjFlMTU3NzNiYWMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAyMjQ3NzQ1._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "5,578", "imdbID": "tt9257258", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "1", "Response": "True"}
