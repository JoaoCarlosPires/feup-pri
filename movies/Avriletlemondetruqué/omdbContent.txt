Geopolitics has developed strangely: Napoleon V rules France and, for the last 70 years, scholars have been mysteriously disappearing, depriving mankind of their inventions. Without radio, television, electricity, aviation, and the combustion engine, the world is mired in outdated technology, dozing in the previous century's knowhow dominated by coal and steam. In this bizarre universe, Avril (Marion Cotillard), a teenage girl, Darwin (Philippe Katerine), her talking cat, Pops (Jean Rochefort), her grandfather, and Julius (Marc-Andr\u00e9 Grondin), a young scoundrel and police informer, go off in search of Avril's parents, two of the missing scientists. The quartet will face many dangers and mysteries in this strange new Rigged World.", "Language": "French", "Country": "France, Canada, Belgium", "Awards": "2 wins & 8 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTg1ZWIxODItY2ZjMC00MzMzLTgwMDctNTlmY2YzNjM3NzhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.3/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "97%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "85/100"}], "Metascore": "85", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "7,380", "imdbID": "tt3422078", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "02 Aug 2016", "BoxOffice": "$295,488", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
