A tooth being pulled hangs on tight. Just then, the radio reports \"Old King Cole has the blues\" and Oswald races off in his car. He gathers up a collection of comics: Charles Chaplin, Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, etc. At the castle, they start singing off-kilter versions of Mother Goose rhymes, with Al Jolson in a blackface routine, and the king is quickly cheered up. Laurel &amp; Hardy haul in a large pile of pies, and an all-out fight breaks out. The jester, who has been getting jealous of Oswald, kidnaps him during the fight and hauls him into a dungeon, submitting him to various tortures, where we discover that the real torture has been the dentist pulling the tooth all along.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/dyDM1qTm1RKPYACAoXS3T7jYSPK.jpg", "release_date": "1933-11-26", "title": "The Merry Old Soul", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 8}
