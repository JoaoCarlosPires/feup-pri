He gathers up a collection of comics: Charles Chaplin, Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, etc. At the castle, they start singing off-kilter versions of Mother Goose rhymes, with Al Jolson in a blackface routine, and the king is quickly cheered up. Laurel &amp; Hardy haul in a large pile of pies, and an all-out fight breaks out. The jester, who has been getting jealous of Oswald, kidnaps him during the fight and hauls him into a dungeon, submitting him to various tortures, where we discover that the real torture has been the dentist pulling the tooth all along.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 1 nomination total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWNkYTQzOWYtY2EyOS00ODFhLWI2NDYtNGNmZjQzODU4NTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc2NjkzNTg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.0", "imdbVotes": "224", "imdbID": "tt0142655", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
