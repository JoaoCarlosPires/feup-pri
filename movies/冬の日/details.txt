It is based on one of the renku (collaborative linked poems) in the 1684 collection of the same name by the 17th-century Japanese poet Bash\u014d. The creation of the film followed the traditional collaborative nature of the source material \u2013 the visuals for each of the 36 stanzas were independently created by 35 different animators. As well as many Japanese animators, Kawamoto assembled leading names of animation from across the world. Each animator was asked to contribute at least 30 seconds to illustrate their stanza, and most of the sequences are under a minute (Yuriy Norshteyn's, though, is nearly two minutes long).", "popularity": 1.56, "poster_path": "/omjYHYRYMv1FhDwogNcvhrFgZkb.jpg", "release_date": "2003-11-27", "title": "Winter Days", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 11}
