"Excellent.\r\n\r\n<em>'Bolt'</em> is all a joy to watch. On paper, the premise can look a bit ridiculous, don't get me wrong it is, but the film manages to not only make it entertaining but to also make it both amusing and heartwarming.\r\n\r\nThe opening scenes are superbly done, when the cat (dog?) gets let out the bag, so to speak, it does take a few moments to regain its footing but quickly turns into a lot of fun. It's got a pleasing adventure, heartfelt feelings and comedy to keep it fresh.\r\n\r\nThe cast are very good, too. John Travolta (Bolt) and Miley Cyrus (Penny) do very fine jobs in their respective roles, but it's actually Susie Essman who stands out most to me - she gives a super performance as Mittens. A few of the other voices do solid stuff, also.\r\n\r\nThoroughly enjoyed this.""\n"
