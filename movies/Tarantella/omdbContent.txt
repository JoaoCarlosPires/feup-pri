{"Title": "Tarantella", "Year": "1940", "Rated": "Not Rated", "Released": "31 Dec 1940", "Runtime": "4 min", "Genre": "Animation, Short", "Director": "Mary Ellen Bute, Ted Nemeth", "Writer": "N/A", "Actors": "N/A", "Plot": "Abstract animation illustrates Edwin Gerschefski's modernist composition. Two dots - one blue and one orange - appear most often, sometimes large, sometimes small, sometimes overlapping. When the sounds become more staccato, so do the images: wavy lines become squiggles, short nail-like lines go across the screen in rows. The result is a visual representation of abstract music, lively and spirited in spite of its link to a dance composed to sweat out the poisons of a spider bite.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY4NmM0OWYtMDVkMC00YmQwLWFiZGUtYWNhZGY2MjczNzk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0MzU2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.7", "imdbVotes": "471", "imdbID": "tt0033135", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
