"WHY DOES LITTLEFOOT SING ALL THREE OF THE SONGS???? YOU HIRED KRIS KRISTOFFERSON AND HE DOESN'T SING A SINGLE LINE IN THIS MUSICAL???? WHAT HELL????\r\n\r\nThe first song felt like it could have been a bop if it was being sung by someone talented. It had some country and western vibes too, and like, Kris Kristofferson is literally right there... If you're going to bother forcing the musical thing into **every single** sequel, can we at least sometimes have the songs be like... Good?\r\n\r\nOh and the story's dumb I guess.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n"
