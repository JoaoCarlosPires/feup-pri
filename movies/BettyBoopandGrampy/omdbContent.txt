The delighted Betty goes down the street singing \"I'm on My Way to Grampy's\" and is joined by a fireman who is rescuing a damsel-in-distress but tosses her back in the burning building in favor of following Betty...anywhere; a policeman who deserts his traffic-directing at a busy intersection; and two moving men. Betty and her gang arrive at Grampy's, and Grampy shows off a few of his Rube-Goldberg inventions while serving punch-and-cake. Betty thinks the party needs a little music, so Grampy employs several of his contraptions and devices, and all hands are soon dancing to the Hoosier Hotshots' version of \"Tiger Rag.\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyMzcxNDkxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA0NjUyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "315", "imdbID": "tt0026109", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
