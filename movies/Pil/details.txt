She survives of food stolen from the castle of the sinister Regent Tristain. One day, to escape his guards, Pil disguises herself as a princess. Thus she embarks upon a mad, delirious adventure, together with Crobar, a big clumsy guard who thinks she's a noble, and Rigolin, a young crackpot jester. Pil is going to have to save Roland, rightful heir to the throne under the curse of a spell. This adventure will turn the entire kingdom upside down, and teach Pil that nobility can be found in all of us.", "popularity": 4.252, "poster_path": "/mRblB0JaUEC9OZSu3yMyJ1CSSux.jpg", "release_date": "2021-08-11", "title": "The Adventures of Pil", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
