Prior to the ship's departure, she crawls under a freshly-painted, white metal gate and sneaks aboard. The paint from the gate has given her a white stripe on her back that causes everyone to think she's a skunk. An amorous skunk, Pepe Le Pew, spots her from shore and runs underwater to the ship, which has by now been abandoned by frightened crew and passengers, and climbs aboard. Pepe tries to woo the female cat, who runs away from him when she smells his odor.
