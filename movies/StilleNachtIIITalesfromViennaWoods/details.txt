The hand is weathered, the fingers cracked and scarred. The end of a rifle appears and a shot fires. The bullet is visible whirling through space; it caroms and then goes through a pine cone.

Later, the hand holds the bullet between two fingers; another shot is fired.", "popularity": 1.19, "poster_path": "/4m1nI4l3LP08cFD9r5u1xvRZ920.jpg", "release_date": "1993-01-01", "title": "Stille Nacht III: Tales from Vienna Woods", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 10}
