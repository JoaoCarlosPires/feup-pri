The original story is followed reasonably faithfully, though those familiar with this director's other films won't be the least bit surprised by the numerous digressions into Svankmajer territory, living slabs of meat and all. As the opening narration says, it's a film made for children... perhaps?", "Language": "Czech", "Country": "Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, West Germany", "Awards": "1 win & 1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJlNDE2NjItZjEzNy00YWUwLWIxOTEtMTJhZjllMTEwNWY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.5/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "95%"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.5", "imdbVotes": "12,225", "imdbID": "tt0095715", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "11 Apr 2000", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
