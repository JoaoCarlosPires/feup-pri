"One of the best things I can say about the \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d feature movie, now streaming on HBO Max, is that it isn\u2019t wholly terrible. The animation is bright, the human cast delivers enjoyably goofy performances, and the film stays true to the original cartoon\u2019s roots. It isn\u2019t super funny nor creative, but the fun story about a celebrity wedding gone awry and a stuffy New York City hotel that employs a cat to rid them of a mouse problem lays the groundwork for a bit of amusing mayhem.\r\n\r\nBlending classic animation with live action, the effects are better than expected. The actors (including Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Pallavi Sharda, and Colin Jost) do a great job interacting with their cat and mouse counterparts, and the cartoonish elements are reminiscent of the classic Tom and Jerry of the past. The story rekindles the rivalry between the two, but is updated for modern audiences.\r\n\r\nThe physical comedy and sight gags are good for most of the giggles, but that\u2019s where the humor stops. There\u2019s also a lot of unnecessary potty humor and a few questionable plot points (the movie does little to rise above certain stereotypes) that may feel cringe-worthy to some adults.\r\n\r\n\u201cTom and Jerry\u201d isn\u2019t noteworthy at all, but it\u2019s not awful, either. There\u2019s enough here to entertain most kids for a couple of hours.""\n""The spirit of the old cartoons is nowhere to be seen here, and that's the biggest disappointment. There is certainly enough here to entertain families - albeit probably not the parents - and I can envision this film playing on repeat for certain kids. Alas, for anyone looking to recapture the magic of the cartoons and revisiting some old favourites, it's best to look elsewhere.\r\n- Joel Kalkopf\r\n\r\nRead Joel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-tom-and-jerry-a-spiritless-reimagining-of-a-classic-cartoon""\n"
