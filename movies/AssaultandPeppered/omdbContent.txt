Daffy fires a cannon at Speedy, who outruns the cannonball and somehow gets it to turn back on Daffy. Speedy comes by to borrow a cannonball; he climbs into the cannon and rolls it home. Daffy plants land mines between their two forts and then loses the map to Speedy. He finds them, one by one, as he walks home. Speedy gets tired of fighting and goes home, so Daffy celebrates with a 21-gun salute: 21 cannons pointed at Speedy's door, which of course turn back on Daffy just as he pulls the trigger.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJhNmIzN2YtNGZkZC00NjQ1LWEyYTUtMzQzMDMyMzM1NzdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0MzU2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.1", "imdbVotes": "147", "imdbID": "tt0058923", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
