Tweety hides in a millinery store (where Granny happens to be shopping) and hides on a hat. After a store clerk shoos Sylvester outside, she shows Granny a hat with what is thought to be a stuffed bird. Granny buys the hat and wears it immediately. Sylvester spots the hat and immediately begins his pursuit. Among the best gags: Sylvester hiding in a man's hat, and Granny clobbering the man (and puddy) after he makes a fresh remark; Sylvester's tail growing in great length after getting it caught in the elevator door at a department store; and the cat using a bellows to blow Granny's hat into the street, then going after the hat (with the ulterior motive of grabbing his dinner). In the end, Sylvester finally grabs Tweety as he and Granny are riding in a taxi, but the puddy tat getting clobbered when the car enters a low-clearance tunnel.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVlM2U1YTMtMzNhZS00OGE4LTljM2ItNTk0YzFkNzFkZDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDcwNDI2MTk@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "190", "imdbID": "tt0051414", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
