Based on cutting-edge palaeontology and the latest fossil records, DINOTASIA presents a series of vignettes about dinosaurs - both familiar faces and some we have only found out about in the past ten years. The film uses CGI to bring the stories to life, but draws on animation's birth in silent film and early Disney to create proper, traditional visual storytelling. Werner Herzog narrates, reuniting with the team behind GRIZZLY MAN and CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNTQ4MTU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI0NzA2MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.6/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "25%"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.6", "imdbVotes": "388", "imdbID": "tt2387443", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "06 Nov 2012", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
