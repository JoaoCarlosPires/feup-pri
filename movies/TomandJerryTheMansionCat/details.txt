Of course, this means Tom will spend most of the picture chasing Jerry around the house, causing extensive damage. Among the sequences: Jerry shoves Tom into a VCR, then shelves the resulting cassette-sized cat; Tom traps Jerry in a coffeemaker; Jerry traps Tom in a refrigerator, and he comes out again in ice cubes; Jerry sucks Tom and half the living room into a vacuum cleaner; Tom chases Jerry through the yard and into the house on a riding lawn mower. At the end, he crashes the mower into his owner's returning car, and is told he makes a better hood ornament than a house cat.", "popularity": 1.96, "poster_path": "/pVowUEOE8hAAYfrIKzEEJOT1Fvg.jpg", "release_date": "2001-04-08", "title": "The Mansion Cat", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 4}
