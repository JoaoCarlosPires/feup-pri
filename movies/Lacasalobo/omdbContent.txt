Conceived and tyrannically run by former Nazi Paul Sch\u00e4fer, Colonia's covert activities ranged from politically sanctioned torture - on behalf of Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship - to Sch\u00e4fer's personally orchestrated crimes against the children of Colonia. Inspired by a reported case, THE WOLF HOUSE testifies on behalf of semi-fictionalized Colonia captive Maria, a young German girl punished for releasing two beloved pigs. Maria escapes with her 'children' and finds false refuge within a supernaturally sentient house with the capacity to betray Colonia Dignidad's infamous legacy.", "Language": "Spanish, German", "Country": "Chile, Germany", "Awards": "7 wins & 20 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGYwNzc3YmEtYjNlMS00OWM0LTg3ZjEtZjMxMDFlMTk0YThmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTE4MDA1NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.6/10"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "86/100"}], "Metascore": "86", "imdbRating": "7.6", "imdbVotes": "2,194", "imdbID": "tt8173728", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
