Lee, but all the carrier pigeons have been shot down. The soldiers reluctantly decide to use Tweety Bird to deliver the message. The Union soldiers counter with their \"Messenger Destroyer,\" who (appropriately enough) turns out to be Sylvester. Battle gags ensue: Sylvester gets repeatedly blown out of a cannon; Tweety tricks he puddy tat (for a moment, at least) into thinking Union soldiers are marching to battle; and Tweety hiding behind cannons on a fighter ship, resulting in Sylvester getting blown up some more. Ending gag: Sylvester captures Tweety by disguising himself as the South's army general, but it is the puddy tat (not Tweety) who gets it on the firing range. Sylvester: \"It's a good thing pussy cats' got nine lives. With this kind of an army, I'll need them!\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDM2ZGJjMTUtMGE0MS00NWI0LWI2ODctOGEzZDg5OGU3YTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzExMDg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "185", "imdbID": "tt0055360", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
