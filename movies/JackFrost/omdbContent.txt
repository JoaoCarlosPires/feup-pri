A bear cub mocks the idea, via song. He's a grizzly bear, he declares; and he's got a nice, warm coat. Later, his mother tucks him into bed, but he tries to sneak away. She spanks him and puts him back to bed. Tearfully, he runs away from home. He enjoys seeing the jack o' lanterns come to life, and listening to the scarecrow scat sing.
