The attraction takes creative imagination and technical know-how, the hallmarks of Walt Disney Imagineering, to create a state-of-the-art storytelling experience. The adventure begins when guests become rat-sized and board a \u00ab ratmobile \u00bb, a vehicle that looks like a cute version of the furry rodents from the film. Soon the ratmobiles are on a Paris rooftop where they encounter R\u00e9my and the ghost of Gusteau as they discuss the special meal R\u00e9my wants to prepare in guests' honor. Moments later, R\u00e9my's excitement leads to him and the ratmobiles plummeting down to the kitchen floor of Gusteau's restaurant. Being rats in a human world is fraught with danger, so R\u00e9my and his new friends in the ratmobiles have to quickly move out of sight before Chef Skinner spots them. R\u00e9my leads the way as all of the rats move from one tight hiding place to another. Luckily, R\u00e9my's human pal Linguini is there to help.", "Language": "French", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzYmZhNzgtNDJlMy00ZGZmLWFhMDktZmViYTFjOWQ5MmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk1MjAxNzQ@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "N/A", "imdbVotes": "N/A", "imdbID": "tt5539126", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
