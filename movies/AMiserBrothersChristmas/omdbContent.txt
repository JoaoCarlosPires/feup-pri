But what Santa doesn't know is that North Wind has secretly sabotaged the sleigh in the hope of taking Santa's place that year. When Santa takes it out for a spin, he gets caught in the cross fire between the feuding Snow Miser and Heat Miser Brothers and his sleigh comes crashing down. North Wind frames the Miser Brothers for Santa's accident and, with Santa stuck in bed with a bad back, everything falls into place for North Wind to slyly come to the rescue as a temporary Santa. But much to his chagrin, Mother Nature punishes the Miser Brothers by forcing them to put their differences aside and fill in for Santa. In between comedic squabbles, the Brothers rediscover what it means to be family and, along the way, save Christmas for everyone!", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA, Canada", "Awards": "1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYxOTE5NzM0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY4MDE1NzE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "883", "imdbID": "tt1332026", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
