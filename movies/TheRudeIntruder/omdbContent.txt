Smith", "Writer": "Sid Marcus", "Actors": "Daws Butler", "Plot": "The last Chilly Willy release has him and the polar bear in an environmentalist fight with a man on an icebreaker who wants to drill an oil well in the arctic. The point of the movie is admirable, although, understandably in a short cartoon aimed at children, hardly balanced; certainly few adults make serious efforts to be balanced in their positions.The animation is, for the era fairly good, although the story is limited to a few relatively unadorned efforts at mutual destruction. Although Chilly Willy was never a great cartoon character, this was the end of the line for Lantz and a weak, although serious coda to a long and happy career.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ0MzU2YTQtODg5MC00NzUwLTk2NGYtY2U5MDA5NTAwMTM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxMjIzNTQ5._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.2", "imdbVotes": "23", "imdbID": "tt0148688", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
