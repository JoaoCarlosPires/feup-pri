Pluto scares away the first ones they see; Mickey scolds him, then relents. He shows Pluto how to be a pointer, and they set off after another quail, but Mickey accidentally jumps on a bear's nose, and thinks it's Pluto. Meanwhile, Pluto finds the quail and points. The babies climb on board and start picking at his hairs, but Pluto's been told not to move. Mickey finally comes across Pluto, who by now is covered by small animals, and realizes he's being followed by a bear. Mickey tries to reason with the bear, and backs off a cliff, onto Pluto.", "popularity": 2.191, "poster_path": "/9Oejpd9QwEDQ6rrzSw6lJQL8Z0k.jpg", "release_date": "1939-07-21", "title": "The Pointer", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 19}
