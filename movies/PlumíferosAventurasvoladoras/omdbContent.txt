So when a coincidental accident involving colorful paint changes the way he looks, Jack is thrilled about his new appearance. But little does he know that his new look will soon lead him down a path of mistaken identity, adventure and danger. Aurora is a beautiful yellow canary that has been locked up her whole life. When she manages to escape from the mean network tycoon that has kept her caged up, she has trouble readjusting to this life of newfound freedom. When Jack and Aurora fortuitously meet, they will need to rely on each other, as well as their wacky friends (Larry the pigeon, Pete, the humming bird and Claire, the bat) as their case of mistaken identity leads them on a thrilling adventure.
