Sure enough, Honey remains safe on this outing; but Bosko soon finds himself in great peril. His troubles begin with an ostrich that steals his derby. Later, a porcupine will be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the real trouble starts when Bosko spanks a misbehaving monkey, which incurs the wrath of the monkey's enormous father.
