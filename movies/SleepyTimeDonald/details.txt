In this blessed innocent state he makes a nightly call at Daisy's, as if it were the time of their romantic appointment; knowing one should not wake or contradict a sleepwalker, she plays along, but finds it increasingly difficult to follow Donald and prevent him coming to harm when he ignorantly strolls the most dangerous places, such as the lion's cage in the zoo, including impossible ones, such as up a wall and even upside down. When she finally gets Donald safely in bed, he wakes up and thinks, seeing her sneak out, she's the sleepwalker.", "popularity": 3.029, "poster_path": "/54kTKUerTmS5CL1WGGlkc5q54dW.jpg", "release_date": "1947-07-11", "title": "Sleepy Time Donald", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 30}
