"The like... sixth-best version of _Seven Samurai_ to date. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._""\n""A thoroughly enjoyable production from Disney and Pixar.\r\n\r\n<em>'A Bug\u2019s Life'</em> cobbles together nice animation, fun characters and a memorable voice cast. The premise is entertaining, as the film flies through its 95 minute run time. The score is pretty solid, also.\r\n\r\nDave Foley is good in the role of Flik, while Kevin Spacey is actually great as Hopper; shame about the actor himself, obviously. There's a load of other noteworthy members of the voice cast, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Atta), Hayden Panettiere (Dot), Bonnie Hunt (Rosie) and John Ratzenberger (P.T.) as well as many others - one of the studios' best casts.\r\n\r\nI actually prefer, somewhat controversially I guess, <em>'Antz'</em> to this - only marginally though, as I truly like them both. I'd say watch the pair, if you can!""\n"
