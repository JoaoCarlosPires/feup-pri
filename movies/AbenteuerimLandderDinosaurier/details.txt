Finally the eggshells crackled. \"It is a boy\", the dinosaur father shouted luckily. And in a little while, the small Dino played with the other dinosaur children and discovered bit by bit his neighborhood. But some day - the small dinosaur was attending some of his friends - the earth began to tremble. And shortly after, the volcano erupted. The small Dino had to wait until the volcano had eased, before he could run home. But when he arrived he was very frightened. Everything was destroyed. No trace of his family! \"I must find them\", he sobbed. And he started a long and adventurous search.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/3VCIJmnCdh12JKP4xn9qddiPmBn.jpg", "release_date": "2000-02-04", "title": "Dinosaur Adventure", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.4, "vote_count": 12}
