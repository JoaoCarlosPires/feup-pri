Bob the Tomato responds to a fan's letter about \"waiting\" by directing a Bible-times interview with Abraham, Sarah and their promised son. Bob & Junior's patience is tested by splitting camels, a confused nurse, an easily distracted film crew, and a host of other laughable filming disasters! Includes a Silly Song with Larry entitled \"Sneeze If You Need To!,\" and the musical \"misadventures\" of Blunders in Boo-Boo-Ville. This episode also showcases nationally syndicated radio host \"Delilah\" as the voice of Sarah.
