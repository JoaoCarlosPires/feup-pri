Countless are the challenges, either especially set up by Hera or just on his way, but he always triumphs against all odds, delivers otherwise often hopeless mortals and moves on to new adventures.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, New Zealand", "Awards": "7 wins & 21 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTUxZTM5ZWUtNzc3My00ZTAxLWFkZjEtM2FlODQ3MzI3OWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.5", "imdbVotes": "28,843", "imdbID": "tt0111999", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "6", "Response": "True"}
