His life changes when one spring day he is captured, his wool shorn, and thrown back out onto the plateau all naked and pink. But a bounding jackalope who wanders by makes the lamb look at life a little differently in seeing that there is always something exciting in life to bound about.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 1 win & 1 nomination total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMzZDRhNjMtZGM3Ny00MjQwLWI1M2MtODRkNDFmNjNjYzhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgyODgxNjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.9", "imdbVotes": "13,526", "imdbID": "tt0395479", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
