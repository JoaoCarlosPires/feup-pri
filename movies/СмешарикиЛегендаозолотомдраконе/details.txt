But when spineless young Wally tries to use the untested device to cure his cowardice, he ends up even more spineless - by getting accidentally body-switched with a squirmy little caterpillar. Now he has even more to fear than he could have ever imagined, and so do his fellow villagers, as they're dragged into a madcap adventure packed with plane crashes, mistaken identities, erupting volcanoes and angry primitives on the warpath. Boy, do the Kikoriki Crew wish they could switch place now - with anyone.", "popularity": 7.321, "poster_path": "/AwCzt2CX3OmWfwvWQImHJMSF5fQ.jpg", "release_date": "2016-03-17", "title": "Kikoriki.
