Bryan", "Plot": "Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter alive dumb enough to fall for the gag. He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. \"Shoot him now!\" Daffy screams. \"You be quiet,\" says Bugs. \"He doesn't have to shoot you now.\" Daffy insists that he does. After Daffy returns his blasted-off beak to his head, he is doomed to more arguments infected with \"pronoun trouble\" which all have the same result. Later, Bugs dresses as a sexy woman and flirtingly ask Elmer for a duck dinner. Will Daffy get the last laugh? \"Ha, ha, very funny! Ha, ha, ha!\"", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJiMTkzMTUtN2RkOC00MTk1LWI5NzgtOWZjNjNjMzBhZGMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.3", "imdbVotes": "4,232", "imdbID": "tt0045062", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$14,753", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
