To achieve his military needs, he covets a Pok\u00e9mon stronger and more adept than any other, a veritable living war weapon, so he enlists a scientist named Doctor Fuji to create this being from the DNA of the ancestor of all Pok\u00e9mon and most powerful of Pok\u00e9mon, Mew, which Fuji had found on a previous jungle expedition.
