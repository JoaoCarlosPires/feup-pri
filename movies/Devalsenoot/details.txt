He can't help but crank out the occasional false note, just often enough to enrage his listeners and discourage any donations. He dreams of playing a large pipe organ. The juke box drowns him out at a cocktail bar, a church organ drowns him out on a street, pinball machines drown him out at Luna Park. The city's neon lights and commercial posters overwhelm his small art. At the end of the day, he captures the tear of a calliope horse - his sole earnings for the day - which may prove magical.", "popularity": 1.021, "poster_path": "/zjEfochqCGd8ieyrzOfBS17c7fP.jpg", "release_date": "1963-01-01", "title": "The False Note", "video": false, "vote_average": 5, "vote_count": 6}
