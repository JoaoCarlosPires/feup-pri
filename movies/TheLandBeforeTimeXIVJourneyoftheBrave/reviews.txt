"Okay so full disclosure, I learnt after watching this movie that it is actually a follow-on to the Land Before Time TV series which I never watched, so there is some information, including an entire new character, which is involved in _Journey of the Brave_ that I just straight up didn't get, and it's not completely out of the question that negatively impacted my enjoyment of the film.\r\n\r\nBut I can't imagine any TV-prequel could have made me love this.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u00bd: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._""\n"
