A child sits alone on a playground merry-go-round. All around are images of life: a woman reclining, a couple standing. These images revolve as accordion music fills the air. Circular images - the rim of a coffee cup, the merry-go-round, a record - and couples turning in dance suggest the pleasures and connectedness of life. However, the film also returns to a solitary man alone in a flat. Some staircases are circular and lead to meetings between men and women. The staircase outside his flat is angular. Is he alone and outside the circle?", "Language": "N/A", "Country": "Switzerland", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTdlNzdjZjMtYTY4Yi00ZDM1LWE2YWQtMzYxYzRlNGJmMDgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0MzU2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.5", "imdbVotes": "516", "imdbID": "tt0409661", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
