"I saw this excellent Bugs Bunny cartoon as an extra on my blu for 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. Great fun in its own right, and I enjoyed what Leonard Maltin had to say about it in his introduction on the blu for Warner Bros. 1948 version of Night at the Movies (along with the comedic short film, 'So You Want to Be a Detective').""\n"
