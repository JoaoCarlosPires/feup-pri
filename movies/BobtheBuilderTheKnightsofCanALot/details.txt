Unfortunately a case of mistaken identity puts Bob's father in charge, resulting in one disaster after another! Meanwhile, tales of Camelot inspire Bob's noble crew of machines - Sir Lift-A-Sot, Sir Roll-A-Lot and Lady Mix-A-Lot - in their quest to get the job done. And Sir Spud-A-Lot finds a suit of armor and a fiery steed almost perfect for jousting! Back at the castle, Bob's father is a bit of a royal pain, locking himself and Bob in the dungeon and then finding himself mysteriously trapped in a maze! Finally, a medieval pageant celebrates the grand opening of the castle and a great father-son relationship.", "popularity": 0.964, "poster_path": "/12yCtDLtH2VmQZOcjz5rryk6BtX.jpg", "release_date": "2004-11-24", "title": "Bob the Builder: The Knights of Can-A-Lot", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 4}
