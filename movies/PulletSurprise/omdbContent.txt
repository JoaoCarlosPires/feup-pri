He tells Pete what he really wants is a Venezuelan Racing Chicken which has unfortunately run back to Venezuela. Pete runs there and back in jig time. Next, he really wants an Irish Wrestling Chicken, which turns out to be a rope tied to a bull's tail. When Pete makes off with a chicken, nest and all, Foghorn grabs the chicken, then says Pete's found the rare Mongolian Disappearing Chicken, and the only way to make it reappear is tap dancing; Pete dances into a hole; Foggy drops an anvil on Pete's head (\"a whole lotta lumps!\") . Foggy walks away, chuckling at his cleverness, when a genuine Irish Wrestling Chicken pins him (\"I'm glad I didn't show him the Norwegian Exploding Chicken\") .", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM3NWQwODEtODRhZi00ZDM0LTkyMmItOTI1ZGVlZmYyZjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ4ODQxNjI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "96", "imdbID": "tt0119963", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
