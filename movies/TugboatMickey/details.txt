Sadly, Mickey's crew consists of Donald and Goofy, so getting underway to help is not easy. Goofy has to fight a boiler's door to get it stoked with coal (and when he succeeds, he overfills it) and Donald gets tangled up in the machinery. Not to mention that nobody casts off, so they drag half the dock along with them. The overworked boiler soon explodes.", "popularity": 3.427, "poster_path": "/x0krX9LEFmwh02EIMnq6nc7qNrl.jpg", "release_date": "1940-04-26", "title": "Tugboat Mickey", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 41}
