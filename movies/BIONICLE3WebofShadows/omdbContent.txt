There, they find an old enemy has overtaken the great city with the help of Visorak--robotic spiders that can quickly encase anything or anybody in near-indestructible webs. The Toa undergo a bizarre metamorphosis while sealed within strange cocoons, and emerge as clunky-looking machines made up of mismatched parts. Though horrified, they find that they also possess some new powers, which prove essential for their subsequent journey to restore Metru Nui--and themselves. This delightful Bionicle installment is probably easily accessible for any viewer unfamiliar with the series to date.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA, UK, Denmark", "Awards": "3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MTAwMjI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMxNTAzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.8", "imdbVotes": "1,189", "imdbID": "tt0471588", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "12 Apr 2011", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
