He chases one pesky rat inside the house, and shoots a hole in the floor, which he falls through, into a vat of home-brew. With the cat thus away, the rats play, at first dancing and singing, and later playing in the bathtub. The cat eventually sobers up (after he lands in a cactus), and tries to blow up the rats (and house!) with a bomb, but the rats plant the bomb on the cat, who blows up himself, Alice, and several nearby trees.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/yxuJqBlu7D8A6IbQOVFZ6791kaC.jpg", "release_date": "1925-01-01", "title": "Alice Rattled by Rats", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.2, "vote_count": 7}
