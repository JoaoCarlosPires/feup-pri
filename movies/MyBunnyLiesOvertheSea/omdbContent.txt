There he immediately attacks a horrible monster engulfing a defenseless old lady. Only it turns out the \"monster\" is a set of bagpipes and the \"old lady\" is a man in a kilt. Bugs thinks this is indecent and throws a barrel over the Scotsman. This is too much, and the angry Scotsman tries to blow out Bugs's brains. Soon the two opponents settle the matter more civilly - with a game of golf. Bugs's golfing strategy leaves most of his scruples buried under a divot. The infuriated Scotsman suggests one more contest, again underestimating the quick-witted bunny.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFiNGQ4M2ItZTYxNC00MTE4LWIyZDEtZTY0NWE3YzE4Yjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE1NjY5Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.4", "imdbVotes": "1,141", "imdbID": "tt0040625", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
