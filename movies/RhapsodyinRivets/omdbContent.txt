The workmen are dogs in human clothes. Elevators, picks, shovels, and a steam shovel are instruments in music making and construction. As the clock nears 5:00 PM, the crew works furiously, and the Umpire State Building rises toward the clouds. With the pennant planted at the top and the work completed, the foreman takes a bow. Droopy leaves last, closing the door behind him. Is the rhapsody over or are there still a few bars to play?", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar. 1 nomination total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZjNzk0NDAtOTE2Yy00ZjQzLTg1ZTAtOTUyNjIzODU0ZGE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "507", "imdbID": "tt0034097", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
