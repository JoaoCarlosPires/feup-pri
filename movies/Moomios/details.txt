By imperial mandate, Princess Nefer must marry Thut, a former charioteer. None of them wants marriage; Nefer because she craves freedom, and Thut because he is allergic to marriage. But the designs of the gods are irrevocable: Thut must marry Nefer in seven days and bring to the wedding the royal ring that Pharaoh has given him intact; in case something happens to the ring, Thut would pay with his eyes. On the surface of the earth, in the meantime, Lord Silvester Carnaby conducts an archaeological expedition and finds something unique: an Egyptian Royal wedding ring! Thut must go to the human world to retrieve it. He is accompanied by Sekhem, his 12-year-old brother, with his crocodile pet, and Nefer. Together they will live a great adventure in modern London and discover something that was not in their plans: falling in love.", "popularity": 0.99, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "2022-03-18", "title": "Mummies", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
