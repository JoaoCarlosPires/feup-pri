Henery Hawk, dressed as an Indian (\"Me last of mo-hawk-ens!\") comes by as Foggy is looking for someone to relieve him. Foggy gets Henery to egg-sit for a little while, but the little hawk gets impatient. Foghorn sends him off with a \"hen grenade\" which explodes under the dog (leaving him covered with a fried egg). The dog helps the hawk steal the egg, and calls Foghorn's wife. The egg then changes hands several times; Foghorn's wife comes along and beans him with her rolling pin.
