Geef thinks he can resist but is soon upset by all manner of temptations. He goes to bed but sleepwalks to the refrigerator only to discover it is empty. It turns out his reflection ate all the food telling him, \"Eat, drink, and be merry, and tomorrow we diet!\"", "popularity": 2.345, "poster_path": "/xFtRyJIAGA5ngVQal7uaWgBG7b.jpg", "release_date": "1951-06-29", "title": "Tomorrow We Diet", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 18}
