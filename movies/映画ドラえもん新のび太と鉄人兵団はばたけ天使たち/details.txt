His fit makes Doraemon angry, and with the hot Japanese summer, he decides to \"cool off\" at the North Pole with the Anywhere Door, a mysterious portal.  Nobita follows him there after he's gone for a long time, and discovers a strange bowling ball-like orb which starts blinking with a pulsating light, and summons what looks like a giant robot\u00b4s foot. After sledding down the hill on it and having it crash into his room through the Anywhere Door, the bowling ball follows him home through the door and another robot piece falls into his backyard.", "popularity": 29.62, "poster_path": "/jbszRvlAtGGHZK4qOAREHChg2P7.jpg", "release_date": "2011-03-05", "title": "Doraemon: Nobita and the New Steel Troops: ~Winged Angels~", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 31}
