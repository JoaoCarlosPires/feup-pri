Jerry revels in his freedom, among other things turning Tom's picture into a Hitler caricature then spitting on it. But he soon tires of this, and under a flag of truce, hatches a plan with Tom. The abnormally talkative duo stage a grand chase, but whenever they're out of sight of Mammy, they fake it, pausing for patty-cake, a turkey leg, and a drum jam session. Eventually, Tom chases Jerry under a rug, then swaps in a tomato, which Mammy crushes. With Jerry apparently vanquished, Tom is rewarded with a pie, but when Jerry tries to claim his share, Tom shuts him out.", "popularity": 3.27, "poster_path": "/2tKO5NIBHbBaKmT3BsJT8lnx54m.jpg", "release_date": "1943-05-22", "title": "The Lonesome Mouse", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 20}
