"It's rare that I wish a movie could keep going on and on, but Lilo & Stitch could have added a whole hour to its runtime and I would have welcomed it with open arms. This is a beautifully animated film, one of the best Disney has ever put out. Stitch has become something of a pop culture icon. Much like Jack Skellington and Bart Simpson, Stitch has struck an emotional chord with audiences. Aside from him being adorable, it also must have something to do with how Stitch, a being created to destroy, ends up being the missing link that brings a broken family together. There are times that Lilo & Stitch touches on dark subject matter. Lilo reminds me of many problem children that were misunderstood by parents, kids, and the system. But by the end, Lilo & Stitch will have you smiling by bringing you into a very happy place.""\n""Cute film.\r\n\r\n<em>'Lilo & Stitch'</em> is a short and straightforward production, but that doesn't stop it leaving a charming and hearty impression. It's actually rather impressive in that regard, you can't help but feel attached to the main characters.\r\n\r\nDaveigh Chase (Lilo), Tia Carrere (Nani), David Ogden Stiers (Jumba), Kevin McDonald (Pleakley) and, obviously, Chris Sanders (Stitch) are very good. I love their respective voices. Even some of the minor characters, like Zoe Caldwell (Councilwoman), Kevin Michael Richardson (Capt. Gantu) and Ving Rhames (Bubbles), are memorable too. A real cool set.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it isn't actually sensational, undoubtedly pleasant, but not out of this world or anything. As for the music, who knew Elvis Presley's discography would fit so well? An inspired choice, it must be said.\r\n\r\nNot at the top of my list of Disney animated films, but it's certainly in the 'best of the rest' bracket. You should definitely watch this, if you haven't already.""\n"
