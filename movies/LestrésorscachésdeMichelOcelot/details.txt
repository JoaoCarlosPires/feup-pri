It was the first time in my life. But this film was not my first one. I had also made short films, with a very limited distribution. Nobody saw them. I am lucky enough now to introduce them to you, to make these little mechanisms run again; they are the result of perseverance and passion. Besides the almost forgotten past, I have added a dance of today, which I conceived for Bj\u00f6rk. Also something of the future, a post-scriptum to my film \"Azur & Asmar\". In addition to the films, I try to explain the happy magic of these bits of nothing which became my life.
