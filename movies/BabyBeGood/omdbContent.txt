He unbuttons his sleeper, forcing Betty to re-button it. And after Betty turns off the ceiling lamp, Little Jimmy jumps up on his bed and turns it back on again. Once Betty thinks she finally has Jimmy to sleep, she finds him painting stripes on the cat with toothpaste. Jimmy begs Betty to tell him a story, and she does so with an eye toward teaching him a lesson. It's about a mischievous little boy, much like Jimmy, watched over by a fairy, who is much like Betty. He ties a tin can on a little dog's tail; he throws bricks at a glass house; and he clips off the shaving-brush-like hair of the local barber as he sleeps. But the boy goes too far when he taunts a lion, who escapes from his cage and chases him. The kindly fairy gives the boy a chance to reverse everything he does. Literally. Suddenly, everything he has done is played in reverse, leaving a content barber, an untouched glass house and a happy little pooch.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Njc3NzUxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAxMDkyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.8", "imdbVotes": "177", "imdbID": "tt0026091", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
