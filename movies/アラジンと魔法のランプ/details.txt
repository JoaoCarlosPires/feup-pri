The story takes some illogical and confusing jumps at the point where Aladdin begins to court the princess, and the extravagant animation that had characterised Toei films of the 60s, when Toei had the best animators around, had become a thing of the past long before this point; but this is still an above-average film, in large part because of the screenplay that stays so faithful to the original. The character designs are slightly more western-looking than one is accustomed to seeing in anime.", "popularity": 0.96, "poster_path": "/dC2EDGSuoUvo2za7VXv91iZTuo3.jpg", "release_date": "1982-03-13", "title": "Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 4}
