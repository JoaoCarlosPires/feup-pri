When the wicked sorcerer, Zeebad, is released from his ancient prison, he vows to take his revenge on those who captured him and flash-freeze the Earth forever with the power of three mysterious magic diamonds. Now, determined to save the world, a fellowship of four unlikely heroes join forces to thwart Zeebad's villainous plans. Led by candy-loving Doogal, loyal friends, Dylan, the guitar-playing rabbit; Brian, the bashful snail, and Ermintrude, the opera-singing cow, embark on an epic quest to save the world, braving ice-capped mountains, fiery pits of molten lava, and an impenetrable, booby-trapped temple guarded by an army of ninja skeleton warriors. Can Zeebad's wizardry destroy the power of friendship?", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, United Kingdom, France", "Awards": "2 wins & 1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxODg1MTI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjk1MDI3._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "2.9/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "8%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "23/100"}], "Metascore": "23", "imdbRating": "2.9", "imdbVotes": "4,998", "imdbID": "tt0763304", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "16 May 2006", "BoxOffice": "$7,438,000", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
