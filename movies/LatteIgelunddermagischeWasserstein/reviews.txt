"Surprisingly good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThe beginning is a little rough as they're establishing the world and lore of \"The Magic Waterstone\", and they come REALLY close to an underlying racism metaphor a couple of times, but having watched the entire movie, it doesn't seem like it panned out.\r\n\r\nThe characters are just grumpy and likeable enough that each sort of has its own charm.  I would have appreciated more finely tuned characters, but the cg aesthetic does seem to make up for it.\r\n\r\nIt's not a great movie by far, but I think it is good enough that younger audiences will like it and it is well enough composed that adults would be able to watch it with their kids without being too bored.""\n"
