"Didn't expect this to be good, and yet it is.\r\n\r\n<em>'Brother Bear 2'</em> can feel like a slight retread and it does the overdone Disney romance stuff, it also ends as dissatisfying as the original. With all that noted, it is actually an enjoyable and respectable sequel. The new characters are fun, as the older ones remain just that.\r\n\r\nThe animation looks similar, leaving equal impressions to the 2003 production. Patrick Dempsey is arguably better as Kenai than Joaquin Phoenix, or at least his voice suits better. The music, as much as I do like Phil Collins' efforts, is definitely improved here in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAll in all, given all that I've mentioned, it still tallies up lower than the first film. However, it does do some things well and it merits credit for that.""\n"
