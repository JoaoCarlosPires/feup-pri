It's a tough enough challenge for the world's friendliest ghost. But when he goes to Scare School to learn his craft, he uncovers a plot by Alder and Dash, the cruel, two-headed headmaster, to take over the world. With only himself and his misfit pals Ra, a mummy with \"unraveling issues,\" and Mantha, a zombie who can't keep her limbs on, the odds are stacked against him.
