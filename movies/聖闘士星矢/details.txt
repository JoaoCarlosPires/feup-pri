An orphan herself, Eri takes a liking to Hy\u014dga and one night they sit outside watching the stars. They see a shooting star and Hy\u014dga asks Eri to make a wish. After Hy\u014dga leaves, however, Eri becomes powerfully attracted to the shooting star and wanders alone into the woods, where she finds a golden apple. She is then possessed by Eris, the Goddess of Discord, and kidnaps Athena, planning to use the golden apple to suck her energy out, fully reincarnate and take over the world. Eris leaves a message for the Bronze Saints, who set out for the goddess's temple which appears on the mountains. There, the heroes fight the five Ghost Saints: Maya of Sagitta, Orpheus of Lyra, Christ of the Southern Cross, Jan of Scutum (called by the Japanese name Tateza) and J\u00e4ger of Orion.", "popularity": 28.959, "poster_path": "/jvY3GcoG34J1D9OBEN8Qb6GfU8p.jpg", "release_date": "1987-07-18", "title": "Saint Seiya: Evil Goddess Eris", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 144}
