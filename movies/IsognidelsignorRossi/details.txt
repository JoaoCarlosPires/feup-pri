He lives with Gastone, his dog-friend,who, after a week of loneliness, can't wait to go out, for instance to the movies, and have fun. Gastone as a matter of fact is a passionate fan of movies, television and heroes' books. He always compares Rossi with them and nags with a petulant : \"Rossi, Rossi, if you only were...braver, stronger, richer...\". His continuous complaints push Rossi to identify himself with those heroes; throughout the film we will meet Rossi-Tarzan, Rossi-Astronaut, Rossi-Sherlock Holmes, Rossi-Zorro, Rossi-Hollywood actor, Rossi-scientist, Rossi-Lancelot, Rossi-Aladdin. Eight fantastic adventures in which Rossi, along with faithful Gastone, relishes the joy of being a hero.", "popularity": 1.18, "poster_path": "/v4i2Sde2sRK6rsmTaQYFSo5pxQU.jpg", "release_date": "1977-08-04", "title": "Mr. Rossi's Dreams", "video": false, "vote_average": 7, "vote_count": 3}
