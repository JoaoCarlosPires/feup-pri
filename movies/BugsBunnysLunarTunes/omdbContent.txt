This anthology of sorts follows Bugs, who's been abducted by alien Marvin the Martian and taken to space court to represent Earth, since Earth has been charged for presenting a threat to outer space. Marvin has launched a doomsday rocket (his infamous explosive space modulator) and if Bugs can't prove Earth's innocence in the matter, Earth is done for. Marvin, in the role of a self-proclaimed prosecutor, uses clips from several shorts, including \"Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century\", \"His Hare-Raising Tale\", \"Martian Through Georgia\", \"Lighter Than Hare\" and \"Rocket-Bye Baby\", to prove his point. On the other hand, Bugs also uses clips from several shorts, including \"The Hasty Hare\" and \"Hare-Way To The Stars\", to support his defense and show that Marvin has his own share of blame in the matter. What will the harsh but fair alien judge decide?", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ2NjZlNzYtZGY4NC00OWNiLWJlNDgtMTFmYWY0ZGI1YzU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzExMDg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.5", "imdbVotes": "51", "imdbID": "tt0278993", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
