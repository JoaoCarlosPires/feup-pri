Returning to Japan, they take seemingly opposite paths: one becomes a politician, the other a gangster. As Asami and Houjou work through the linked worlds of politics and crime in modern Japan, they don't hesitate to do anything necessary to secure their own positions and stay true to their vow. Loyal to no one else, they find their friendship increasingly tested as they rise in their chosen fields.", "popularity": 1.385, "poster_path": "/zc9kBMZWL3ASvtPXi2KgTM4j7BA.jpg", "release_date": "1996-05-01", "title": "Sanctuary", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 3}
