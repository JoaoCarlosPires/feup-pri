Born on a Baja, California beach in 1959, new hatchling Sammy must do what his fellow newborn sea turtles are doing: race across the beach to the ocean before they are captured by a seagull or crab. Thus begins Sammy's incredible fifty-year ocean journey. Along the way he meets his best friend, a fellow turtle named Ray, and overcomes obstacles both natural and man-made while trying to fulfill his dream of travelling around the world. Throughout his voyage, Sammy never forgets about Shelly - the turtle he saved on his first day and loves passionately from afar. Based on the actual trajectory of a sea turtle's life, the film illustrates the dangers humans pose to the species' survival. The film combines entertainment with an important environmental message.", "popularity": 15.65, "poster_path": "/3rl95Ml7Igdkc5QKe2GEUWa1SFU.jpg", "release_date": "2010-08-03", "title": "A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 491}
