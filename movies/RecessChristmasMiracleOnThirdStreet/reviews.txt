"Yet another forced animated sequel from Disney.\r\n\r\n<em>'Recess Christmas: Miracle On Third Street'</em> is a compilation of four different stories, which as always leads to a disjointed film. While the stories themselves are somewhat entertaining, they add nothing to the preceding film.\r\n\r\nThe animation is a step down but still satisfactory, just like everything else including the cast. On that note, it is cool to hear two well known voices appear in James Earl Jones (Mister) and Michael McKean (Mr Bream) - not that they add much to the film, admittedly.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you love the television series then I am sure you'll enjoy this. However, with a few exceptions, these 'Frankenstein's monster' films are usually always a mess and this isn't much different unfortunately. Just stick and have belief in one story, it isn't that hard to do so.""\n"
