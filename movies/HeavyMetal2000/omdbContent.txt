Upon discovery of a shard of the Loc-Nar (the evil orb from the original movie), a miner named Tyler becomes possessed by an insatiable hunger for power and a thirst for immortality. On his way to a planet which has the immortality fountain, Tyler makes a brief stop on F.A.K.K.\u00b2 (Federation-Assigned Ketogenic Killzone) because its inhabitants carry some immortality water in their bodies. Tyler invades the space colony, wipes out most of the inhabitants, and kidnaps a beautiful woman named Kerrie. Enraged by Tyler's careless rampage, Kerrie's beautiful sister Julie vows to avenge her family and wipe out Tyler before he reaches the fountain.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Canada, Germany", "Awards": "1 nomination", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMDM0MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODE5MDc5._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.4/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "10%"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.4", "imdbVotes": "8,176", "imdbID": "tt0119273", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "17 Oct 2000", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
