The narrative is non-linear with no dialog and loosely follows the song lyrics and chorus. The video feels like a very compressed version of an epic Miyazaki film. The story follows two police men in a futuristic setting in their repeated attempts at rescuing a mysterious winged girl.", "popularity": 5.802, "poster_path": "/bQIsgvkGaKAgqkiRi1IOmb37dlm.jpg", "release_date": "1995-07-15", "title": "On Your Mark", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 89}
