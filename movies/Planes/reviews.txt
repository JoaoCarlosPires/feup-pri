"There's just (and I mean just) enough there for a good time.\r\n\r\nI like <em>'Planes'</em> If I'm honest, even if it does feel like a copy of <em>'Cars 2'</em> in quite a few places; the biggest one being the race around the world. I don't love Dane Cook as Dusty either, but I can't deny that after viewing this I feel fine about it.\r\n\r\nIt was always going be similar to the <em>'Cars'</em> films, given this is set in the same universe as that franchise. However, they should've done more to separate it though, especially with the overall premise and the characters.\r\n\r\nAway from Cook, who I feel sounds too wooden in the lead role, the cast is actually fairly decent. Stacy Keach (Skipper), Priyanka Chopra (Ishani) and Teri Hatcher (Dottie) are enjoyable.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure why this leaves a positive impression - I can see why many dislike this, but I didn't. It narrowly creeps a 7 for me.""\n"
