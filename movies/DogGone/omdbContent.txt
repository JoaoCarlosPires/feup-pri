{"Title": "Dog Gone", "Year": "1926", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "15 Sep 1926", "Runtime": "7 min", "Genre": "Animation, Comedy, Short", "Director": "Charles R. Bowers, Bud Fisher", "Writer": "Bud Fisher", "Actors": "N/A", "Plot": "\"Dog Gone\" is an installment of Bud Fisher's very popular \"Mutt &amp; Jeff\" cartoon series. I've seen quite a few of these films and this one is about average...however the content is anything but average!When the story begins, Mutt has been appointed judge of a local dog show. He convinces Jeff to dress up like a dog and the plan is that Mutt will give his buddy the prize. However, when this happens, the dogs in the show lose it and chase Jeff from the building. Outside is a sausage man who is eagerly scooping up the pooches in order to turn them into sausages!! Can Jeff manage to escape or is he destined for the grinder as well?While this is a very sadistic and strange cartoon short, it's NOT without precedent. 1904's \"Dog Factory\" is a live-action film with a similar theme. Both are weird and well worth seeing...particularly \"Dog Factory\".", "Language": "None", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2JmZjZkYmItN2I3Yi00ZjkyLWJjNjEtMTYwNTljNmMyODE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ1NjM2MDg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.7", "imdbVotes": "48", "imdbID": "tt0016800", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
