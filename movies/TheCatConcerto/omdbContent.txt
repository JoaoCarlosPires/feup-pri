Jerry is pummeled by hammers, bounced by wires, and squeezed by Tom as the cat tries to play the concerto while dispensing with Jerry. Jerry's defensive antics add to the brio of the program and answer Tom with Jerry's own skillful musical attack. By the concerto's end, the duet leaves only one animal standing for the audience's applause.", "Language": "None", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Won 1 Oscar. 1 win & 1 nomination total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiNWI3ZGMtZWM2MC00NTFkLTljZmYtODViNTI3OWJhODdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgyODgxNjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.2", "imdbVotes": "4,202", "imdbID": "tt0039251", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
