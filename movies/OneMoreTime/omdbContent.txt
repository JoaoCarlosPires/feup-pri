He has no trouble with a single criminal who pops out of a trashcan and sprays bullets at him with a machine gun. Foxy has his own gun. It shoots out an expandable arm with a platform on the end. A mouse with a mallet stands on the platform and knocks the criminal unconscious. Foxy has a bit more trouble with a hippo who runs him over. She begs him not to fine her. He gives in, but throws a trashcan over her head to show his contempt. Foxy's real trouble begins with a gang of criminals armed with a grenade, a machine gun and mouthfuls of tobacco juice. They kidnap Foxy's girlfriend. The bushy-tailed cop hops on a wooden horse, and the chase is on.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2I0YmE4MjctM2FjOS00NGM3LTljMzctMjUyZTU5YmUzMTAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgyODgxNjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.8", "imdbVotes": "269", "imdbID": "tt0022231", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
