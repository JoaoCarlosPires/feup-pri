"The animation really takes a nosedive in this one. It's similar in style, but much lower in quality. Probably the _Land Before Time_ movie for people who like modern era History Channel content.\r\n\r\n(Edit: Okay I'm currently watching the 10th film, and yes, _Stone of Cold Fire_ definitely has the worst animation of them all... So far.)\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product. _""\n"
