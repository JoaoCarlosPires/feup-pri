When a jaguar attacks Abeguar and Jana\u00edna, he jumps off a cliff with her and he flies. The shaman advises Abeguar that he was the chosen one by the god Munh\u00e3 to lead his tribe and fight against the evil Anhang\u00e1. When the tribe leader Piat\u00e3 joins the French in the fight against the Portuguese, the entire Tupinamb\u00e1s are slaughtered and Abeguar turns into a bird that flies for more than two hundred years to find Janaina. In 1825, the warrior is Manuel Balaio that lives with Jana\u00edna and their two daughters in Maranh\u00e3o. When one of his daughters is raped by the abusive police commander, Balaio leads the oppressed locals against the police and they take down the Caxias city. The government sends Duque de Caxias and his troops that vanquish the rebels and Balaio turns into a bird again that flies for more than one hundred and forty years to find Jana\u00edna again. In 1968, in Rio, the warrior is Cau, but Jana\u00edna is a revolutionary student that lives with another insurgent. When Cau and Jana\u00edna are arrested by the repressive police, Cau rats the insurgents to protect Jana\u00edna from the torture and he becomes an outcast by his former fellows. Only the jailer Feij\u00e3o talks to him and Cau teaches him politics. With the amnesty, Cau moves to the slums with Feij\u00e3o and becomes a teacher and member of the criminal group Falange Vermelha. When the police invade the slum, Cau turns into a bird again that flies for more than one hundred years to find Jana\u00edna again. In 2096, in Rio de Janeiro, very few people can afford water that is mostly used in the ethanol plantations by the governmental company Aquabr\u00e1s. The warrior is now a journalist and Jana\u00edna a call-girl. When the president of Aquabr\u00e1s is kidnapped by a group of insurgents, the warrior sees Jana\u00edna on television and heads to Aquabr\u00e1s to save her.", "Language": "English, Portuguese", "Country": "Brazil, United States", "Awards": "3 wins & 9 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0MzAyODM0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA1MTA4OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "1,531", "imdbID": "tt2231208", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "25 Aug 2018", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
