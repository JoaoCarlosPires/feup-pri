Pluto tries to sneak off, but the chick that swallowed the hopper comes hopping along and bumps into Pluto. He feels sorry for it and is soon overrun by chicks again. He helps them scratch up a worm. The hen returns and argues with Pluto over the babies. She brings the rooster into the argument. While they fight, the babies run to the doghouse.
