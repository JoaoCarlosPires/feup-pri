Only birds and man can sing; man \"sings\" even when he speaks. We see a quick survey of the stages of life, as captured by songs: the alphabet song for primary school, Here Comes the Bride, The Old Gray Mare, etc. Some inspirations for song are outlined in song: love, sailing, trains, the West, motherhood, etc., but \"we never sing about brains.\" Finally, an example of how a simple melody can be expanded into a symphony: an elaborate version of the simple tune that opened the lesson.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FiYzNjNDQtMTY5Ny00NDRiLWE5ZGQtMjk1OWZjMDczZmJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIyNjIyODU3._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.5", "imdbVotes": "307", "imdbID": "tt0046064", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
