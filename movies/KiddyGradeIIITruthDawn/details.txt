Unsurprisingly, crime has grown alongside technology, and thus the GOTT, Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs, is formed as a sort of universal police force. Within this organization, there is a special (and secret) branch known as the ES Force (ES standing for \"Encounter of Shadow-work\"), consisting of twelve young people that possess amazing superpowers. Each ES member operates with another as a team, and the series' focus is a team of two low-level members, \u00c9clair and Lumi\u00e8re. As the series progresses, they start to see the darker side of GOTT and its secrets.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/j9hAb8nK8FD2sTXqtX4xs9TyPSB.jpg", "release_date": "2007-09-01", "title": "Kiddy Grade III: Truth Dawn", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 1}
