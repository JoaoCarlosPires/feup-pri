In one tale, Heathcliff's pop gets parole, although Heathcliff thinks he's escaped; in another, Heathcliff's \"good angel\" conscience makes a short-lived appeal to his saintly side. Nostalgia reigns as the tabby holy terror plays various roles of television star, wrestling champ, and neighborhood bully.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Canada, France, USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJmYjkyOTctNmM5NC00OTY1LTliOGEtMGIyMzkzZDY0ODM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.5", "imdbVotes": "221", "imdbID": "tt0104401", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "$2,610,686", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
