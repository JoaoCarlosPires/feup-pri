At first, his plans for rest are disturbed by an open window shade which lets light from a flashing sign in. After that problem is dealt with, Donald is kept awake by a persistently dripping faucet. Donald tries to ignore it but after a while, it becomes aggravating to put it mildly. Donald makes several attempts to stop the dripping and finally at least is able to keep it under control via a Rube Goldberg contraption. At this point, Donald receives a call from his water company telling him he hasn't paid his water bill so they're cutting off his water!", "popularity": 1.49, "poster_path": "/93ZZj5nHjxgKrebxjnDIg6sEzJ7.jpg", "release_date": "1948-03-05", "title": "Drip Dippy Donald", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 23}
