He and Assaf, who write together on the school newspaper, the Tides Gazette, are each other's only true friend at the school - Dash the alpha between the two - no one in the school who reads the paper. The only other person with who they associate is Verti, the paper's editor. The school year doesn't start as Dash would hope as not only are he and Assaf and by association the newspaper as ignored as they were last year, but Assaf has found a new alpha in his life, namely Verti as the two embark on a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. But Dash ends up discovering something in the school's archives which has the potential to change fundamentally the nature of the school in its entirety, the story, which he wants to expose, at its core the corruption of school authority. With this information, Dash, who may know better than most what to do if his prediction comes to fruition to save the school and the lives of his classmates, has to find his voice, which he may be able to do with some others who he least expects.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "2 wins & 13 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1ODk0NzEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ2MzQ1MTI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.1/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "85%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "72/100"}], "Metascore": "72", "imdbRating": "6.1", "imdbVotes": "1,120", "imdbID": "tt5538568", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "23 Jan 2018", "BoxOffice": "$68,883", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
