Dash (Jason Schwartzman) and his best friend Assaf (Reggie Watts) are preparing for another year at Tides High School muckraking on behalf of their widely-distributed but little-read school newspaper, edited by their friend Verti (Maya Rudolph). But just when a blossoming relationship between Assaf and Verti threatens to destroy the boys' friendship, Dash learns of the administration's cover-up that puts all the students in danger. Hailed as \"the most original animated film of the year\" and \"John Hughes for the Adult Swim generation\", the film's everyday concerns of friendships, cliques and young love remind us how the high school experience continues to shape who we become, even in the most unusual of circumstances.", "popularity": 3.126, "poster_path": "/j3hcw7faHyIlVBixdgNMkLW6CzT.jpg", "release_date": "2016-09-11", "title": "My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 25}
