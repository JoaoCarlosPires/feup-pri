They would sometimes ride when I was trying to get my young daughter to sleep and caused great aggravation for me. The neighbors became quite worried as well and eventually the police were engaged to stop the racing, unsuccessfully. Stories began to spread about who the youths were and what poor conditions their parents were raising them in. The film attempts to capture the anxiety of the neighborhood, using negative space as a mask to subvert the audience's expectations of horizon and depth. In contrast, much of the content underscores the triviality of the perceived threat.", "popularity": 1.187, "poster_path": "/1dFXMtlAT5kQHwEE1oRVt6M82ni.jpg", "release_date": "2021-10-15", "title": "Lightmare", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
