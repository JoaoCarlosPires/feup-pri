"This is the most incredible movie I've ever seen :)""\n""Another great movie from Pixar. The story in entangling and is structured in a master way to show us in a nice recreation how the mind works and emotions like sadness are important for a healthy life.\r\n\r\nA must to be seen.""\n""A powerfully moving story, Inside Out takes place inside the mind of a young girl, Riley, as she tackles relatively normal hassles, from growing up to moving away. Inside her mind comes five emotions, all with different perceptions of life.\r\n\r\nThere's Joy, who takes charge and her job is to keep Riley content, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, and together, they work together (or try) to keep Riley from harming herself. They live together in the headquarters, or Riley's head, and they look after Riley's memories.\r\n\r\nAfter eleven years of enjoyment and content, Riley and her parents are forced to move out of Minnesota, away from her friends and hockey team, and moves to the city of San Francisco inside a desolate and cold house.\r\n\r\nBut things get even more anarchic when Joy and Sadness are sundered away from the rest of the gang, holding onto Riley's core memories that make Riley, well, Riley. One by one, the islands of personality fall apart as the rest of the gang back in headquarters watch in dismay and anguish. After all, Joy is not there to keep things under control.\r\n\r\nInside Out truly contemplates the hardships of growing up, but every problem comes to a heart-wrenching solution. The movie truly captivates this and continues the Pixar tradition of inspiration, family, and friendship in a little bit under two hours. Watch this, you must.""\n""I think this is one of the best animated feature films I have ever seen, perhaps even the best one. It is very imaginative, for a start, colorful in ways that capture the eye, and its message is as deep as you want it to be.\r\n\r\nBy that I mean it would be productive and fun to watch this with children of all ages. The older or more mature the child is, the deeper you can delve into the issues of what to do about feelings of anger, sadness, and so on. With young children, you could even watch it first time through as it is, and save comments or life lessons for additional viewings. There is plenty of action and humor to be found here to entertain hem on that level.\r\n\r\nAnd as a side note, we have no small children to watch this with, but it is also a good movie for adults to settle into, especially during times of stress or worry. We read a recommendation for it during the COVID19 crisis.""\n""Sweet story.\r\n\r\n<em>'Inside Out'</em> produces an entertaining, heartfelt 95 minutes. I like how the characters work and how their world is set up, conceptually it works very nicely but visually I don't love it - something about the way it looks is kinda plain to me. While Joy & Co. are memorable, the voices behind them aren't all that standout in my opinion.\r\n\r\nPhyllis Smith is my pick of the cast, she is the perfect person to play the character Sadness. Amy Poehler (Joy) and Lewis Black (Anger) are more than satisfactory, too.\r\n\r\nIt has a good message and meaning, for me it's just missing something extra. Still enjoyed it though.""\n""Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully little story of world building and exploration of the human mind through a young teen girl who is scare of the huge amount of change happening in her life.  The parallel of internal struggle and outward reaction to adversity really sets this movie apart.\r\n\r\nThe audience is literally taken on a exploration of the mind, and the story is not only fun, but capable of serious philosophical concepts.  Because it exemplifies \"show, don't tell\" those conversations are compacted into palatable actions by the characters.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie that might make you laugh, cry or both.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to believe that someone wouldn't relate to this somehow, and probably more that they wouldn't enjoy it at all.""\n"
