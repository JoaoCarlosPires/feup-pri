He informs her that he has come to destroy humanity as punishment for their corruption, just as it was done in ancient times. He dismisses Seiya and the Bronze Saints, as she will now be guarded by Abel's three Corona Saints, Atlas of Carina, Jaow of Lynx and Berenike of Coma Berenices, and the five resurrected Gold Saints who died in the Sanctuary battle: Saga of Gemini, Deathmask of Cancer, Shura of Capricorn, Camus of Aquarius and Aphrodite of Pisces. When Athena rebels against Abel's plan, he attacks her, sending her soul to Elysion, the final resting place from which there is no return. The Bronze Saints immediately rush to the Sanctuary to save her and ultimately overcome Abel.", "popularity": 28.91, "poster_path": "/7I7x2eMUwjroTmHfIn4WCr9Ls27.jpg", "release_date": "1988-07-23", "title": "Saint Seiya: Legend of Crimson Youth", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 124}
