The man at the station tells him what it was like back in 1849 in San Francisco, which we see. A sucker is hauled off the street and sat down at a card game; he dashes off as soon as someone shouts \"they found gold in the hills\" but others stake claims before he can. He ends up chopping off a cliff, falling down, and landing in the hospital. The doctor gives him news of another gold strike and he rushes out to begin panning. After some more mining gags and a song, we see a montage of more failed gold strikes. Back to the present day, where the storyteller claims to have sworn off gold, until a rider passes through with news of another strike, when he trades the station for the car and sets out after the gold.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/hj82n9FGIgqy4FnyXSEg0n18Xm2.jpg", "release_date": "1939-02-25", "title": "Gold Rush Daze", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 5}
