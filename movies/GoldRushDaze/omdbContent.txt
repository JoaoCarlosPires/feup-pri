The man at the station tells him what it was like back in 1849 in San Francisco, which we see. A sucker is hauled off the street and sat down at a card game; he dashes off as soon as someone shouts \"they found gold in the hills\" but others stake claims before he can. He ends up chopping off a cliff, falling down, and landing in the hospital. The doctor gives him news of another gold strike and he rushes out to begin panning. After some more mining gags and a song, we see a montage of more failed gold strikes. Back to the present day, where the storyteller claims to have sworn off gold, until a rider passes through with news of another strike, when he trades the station for the car and sets out after the gold.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjNiMDkyMzMtZThkOC00NjgxLWE1N2YtNWY4MmNkZDkzMjlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxMzM3NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.9", "imdbVotes": "187", "imdbID": "tt0031376", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
