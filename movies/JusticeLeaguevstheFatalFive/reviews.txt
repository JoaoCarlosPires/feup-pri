"I appreciate some of DC's smaller characters getting decent screentime in these sorts of things, but as with most of the animated offerings Warner Bros. serves up in this franchise, I didn't find it had any hook.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n""I wasn't quite sure what it was that bugged me about this movie at first. Then I realized that I didn't care. It wasn't so much a dislike of it as I simply didn't care. I didn't care about the characters. I didn't care about the plot. I didn't care about the stakes. I just didn't care.\r\n\r\nThis probably has to do with there being little to no characterization. The new characters (Jessica Cruz, Starboy, Miss Martian, etc.) are given personality quirks instead of actual characters. Sometimes they get downright annoying. Who are these people? How did Jessica Cruz get her GL ring? Who is Mr. Terrific? Where did Miss Martian come from? All these questions and more...will not be answered and you just have to accept that they appeared out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe plot doesn't get much better. The motivation for the villains? Seems to be little more than twirling their mustaches. The stakes? Unconvincing at best.\r\n\r\nAll around, this had the potential to introduce new characters in interesting was, but instead trips over it's own feet coming out the door with sloppy, shallow writing.""\n"
