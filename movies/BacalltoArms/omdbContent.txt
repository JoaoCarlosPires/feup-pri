The show opens with a newsreel called Warmer News. It presents the implementation of war to peace time use. With the help of radar the father of a family can detect the approach of his mother-in-law, and hide the entire house before she arrives. During the newsreel a wolf in the auditorium falls asleep, but when the feature starts, he quickly awakens. The feature presents the two stars Bogey Gocart and Laurie Bee Cool in \"To Have-To Have-To Have-To Have-To Have-To Have-To Have-To Have\". When Laurie in the film asks \"Anybody have a light?\", the wolf in the audience gets randy. And when she continues: \"You only have to whistle\", the wolf starts whistling loudly.
