A mysterious doll called a revenge doll has been handed down at the inn for a long time. The doll looks like a Japanese doll, but it was a cursed doll that would get angry and get revenge if it was swearing or defiled ...  Ranma, who doesn't know that, inadvertently breaks the revenge doll apart. Ranma hurriedly fixes the doll, but the method of fixing it was so ill-advised that the doll became angry and tried to revenge Ranma. The revenge doll takes over Akane's body and instead pushes Akane's soul into the doll, pretending to be Akane and approaching Ranma. However, the revenge doll, who failed in all revenge, invites Ranma this time and tries to let him be alert with a color scheme.  On the other hand, Akane, who is pushed into the doll, aims at Ranma with the doll's body in order to stop the revenge of the revenge doll.", "popularity": 2.576, "poster_path": "/kbs56v9VvGejUGQDUTfr1zGOht5.jpg", "release_date": "1996-01-19", "title": "Ranma \u00bd Super OVA", "video": false, "vote_average": 0, "vote_count": 0}
