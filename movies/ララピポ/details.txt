There\u2019s a chubby freelance writer who\u2019s so obsessed with masturbating to the sound of his upstairs neighbors going at it that he forgets to deal with his own love life and when he finally does have sex he is immediately filled with self-loathing. The upstairs neighbor\u2019s story then splits off like an amoeba: she\u2019s an office lady seduced by a \u201ctalent scout\u201d who is falling down the sex industry ladder, moving from hostess, to massage girl, to private karaoke attendant. The talent scout\u2019s story then splits off and runs in its own direction, revealing the sorry state of this young pimp\u2019s soul. From there, the movie takes more and more time to consider the lives of more and more characters until the entire Japanese sex industry is filled with the wailing of lost souls.", "popularity": 1.939, "poster_path": "/zTS73GCMGntBeGgVaqL71HDROn3.jpg", "release_date": "2009-02-07", "title": "Lala Pipo: A Lot of People", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 7}
