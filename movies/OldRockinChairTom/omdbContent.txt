As Mammy and Tom crash to the bottom of the stairs, she tells him he's getting too old, and introduces his replacement, Lightning. Lightning quickly dispatches Jerry, kisses Mammy's hand, and opens the door for her as she heads to bed. He just as quickly raids the fridge, and frames Tom when Mammy comes after him. That gets Tom kicked out, too, and he and Jerry hatch a scheme. As Lightning sleeps, they shove an iron into his mouth, then use a magnet to slow him down. As Jerry shakes Mammy's stool again, Tom holds Lightning back, until a desperate Mammy calls for Tom again. Tom kicks Lightning out (hurting his foot on the iron), and Mammy rewards Tom with a pie, which he splits with Jerry.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczMzhiNmYtNDA5ZS00MDg0LWJiOGQtMzA0MjM1MmE3MTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxODMyODU@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.0", "imdbVotes": "1,090", "imdbID": "tt0040661", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
