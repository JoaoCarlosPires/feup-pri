"A tedious watch. Non-fans of the show won't like this.\r\n\r\n<em>'Recess: All Growed Down'</em> is another compilation film, though at least this one has a firmer overall theme to it unlike <em>'Recess Christmas: Miracle On Third Street'</em>. The story features the kindergarten kids, which is mildly interesting but it's dumbed-down a little - this feels aimed solely at children, way more than the preceding two productions anyway.\r\n\r\nAndrew Lawrence's absence as T.J. is surprisingly noticeable, his replacement's voice probably adds to what I mentioned earlier in terms of sounding more kiddy. None of the rest of the cast are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nEvidently people seem to like this film, fair enough I guess. It isn't one I enjoyed though.""\n"
