"Can we please go back to a world where voice actors exist... Oh and bland stories don't, ideally?\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._""\n""Didn't find enjoyment with this, personally.\r\n\r\nI found things a bit off with <em>'Missing Link'</em>, none of it really clicked for me - it's without a little added oomph. I was watching it unfold, as opposed to feeling invested in it. The plot is fine, just a bit bland. I found the dialogue decent, particularly with Link's schtick - though that wore off eventually.\r\n\r\nA lot of what I just mentioned probably comes down to the casting, which is meh to me. Zach Galifianakis, Hugh Jackman and Zoe Saldana are all very good actors, but none of them stood out - Galifianakis, especially, feels flat. The supports don't impress either, despite some decent names.\r\n\r\nFrom <em>'Kubo and the Two Strings'</em>, my favourite Laika production, to this - my least favourite entry from the studio. They are, however, still yet to produce a film I dislike - so that's a plus.""\n"
