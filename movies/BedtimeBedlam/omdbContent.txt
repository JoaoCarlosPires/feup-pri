Not one to pass up this much money, he jumps at the chance. He shows the parents out and settles in. Unfortunately, when he checks in on the infant, the \"baby\" is revealed to be a pet gorilla! Woody is reluctant but realizes, if he sticks it out, he will be rewarded with $50. After a nightmarish experience looking after the ape (and trying to put it to sleep), Woody finally is able to at least watch TV where he sees a news report about the gorilla's parents who just left and are now going on a 20-year-long vacation!", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI2ZWMzNTctNmE2Zi00ZTgyLWIwZmQtMjNlYzc4ZjcyZjAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODMwMjk1NDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.1", "imdbVotes": "63", "imdbID": "tt0149832", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
