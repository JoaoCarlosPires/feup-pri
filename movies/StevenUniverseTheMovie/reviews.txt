"Seemed a little unusual to immediately jump backwards into having a Gem be the villain again, considering we'd just resolved that problem on an intergalactic scale with the culmination of a 160 episode television series. Also said Gem's animation style clashes a lot with the animation style of... Well... Everything else. I'm sure that was a conscious decision, but it was one that kept taking my focus. These two things, alongside a very old hat plot for exactly this type of material, meant that in the opening few minutes I was already resigned to not enjoy _Steven Universe: The Movie_, but I gotta say, by the time it was all done, I was totally turned around on this, I was totally vibing with it. Which is not something I can often say for these \"animated spin-off/sequel to a cartoon series\" movies I've seen a fair few of lately.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._""\n"
