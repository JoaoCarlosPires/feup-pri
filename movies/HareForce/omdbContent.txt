She opens it and sees a half-frozen Bugs Bunny, who is exaggerating his sorry plight for effect. Granny buys the act and lets Bugs sleep right next to Sylvester in front of the fireplace. But the jealous dog is having none of it. The first chance he gets, he throws Bugs back out in the cold. Bugs plays on the dog's pity to get back in but can't resist a dirty trick. When a snow sculpture of himself melts, Sylvester thinks it's the real rabbit and succumbs to paroxysms of guilt before he discovers the ruse. From then on, the two play a game of one-upmanship that ends when Granny gets in on the game.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM1YjdlMzMtMmMwNy00ZjQyLWJlODQtNjZjZjNlM2JiZDY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY5Nzc4MDY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.2/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.2", "imdbVotes": "658", "imdbID": "tt0036895", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
