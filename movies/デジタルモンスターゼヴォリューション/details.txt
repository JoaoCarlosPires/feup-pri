Its solution is Project Ark: to wipe out most of inhabitants with the X Program. Yggdrasill chooses a very small percentage to be moved to a new Digital World and then proceeds to destroy the old one. Some Digimon who were not chosen survive anyway, and they move to the new world with a rare gift known as the X Antibody; this antibody changes their appearance and makes them more powerful, while at the same time making them immune to the X Program. No longer in control, Yggdrasill uses the Royal Knights to destroy these X-Digimon, who are outcasts in the new Digital World.", "popularity": 1.843, "poster_path": "/vP1dgNIYXOQo3PB5SMsAjlV7H1J.jpg", "release_date": "2005-03-01", "title": "Digimon X-Evolution", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 3}
