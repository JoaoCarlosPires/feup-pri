"Nothing will beat the first film. The originality fades with most sequels. Unfortunately this is more the rule rather than the exception. For the same reason, I hope they don't bother to create another \"Rango\". That was another fun and brilliant animation in my opinion. Kids will like it and by all means don't avoid it. Just don't have high expectations.""\n""**It's a family time!**\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of this film, except I always loved Minions, particularly their solo film before this one. That prequel was awesome, so much fun. But it's hard to believe, this franchise has already reached three films/parts. Yeah, the Minions helped to find its place among the animation fans, but in this film they were kind of ignored. That's the truth. They had less screenspace which directly affected the film and those who love them.\r\n\r\nGru is set to meet his twin brother, Dru, who is dreaming to be like his father, a supervillain. But now changed Gru is not interested to help his brother. Instead, he uses him to accomplish on what he had failed recently. Okayish story, but it had some good fun. It's almost given a hint about the possible plot for the next sequel. I think kids would enjoy it without expecting much. So a one time watchable film.\r\n\r\n_6/10_""\n""The 80s scene at the beginning was awesome and worth a watch. The rest was the traditional weird mess shared by all the other Despicable Me movies.""\n"
