It\u2019s an animated film that embraces being wonderful even if you look or behave differently than what is perceived as normal. The songs are meaningful and memorable, the animation is beautiful, and the film has several gags sprinkled throughout the film that seem to cater to an adult\u2019s sense of humor. If I Heart Arlo ends up being as good as Arlo the Alligator Boy for a full season, then it will absolutely end up being one of the most heartfelt, hilarious, and relatable animated series ever.\r\n\r\nFull Review: https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Arlo-the-Alligator-Boy-Review-Rickety-Biscuit-A-Gift-to-Animation", "created_at": "2021-04-16T23:11:22.762Z", "id": "607a199a7776f0003f64667c", "updated_at": "2021-06-23T17:05:41.421Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/607a199a7776f0003f64667c"}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}
