{"Title": "Bolek i Lolek na Dzikim Zachodzie", "Year": "1986", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "05 Dec 1986", "Runtime": "95 min", "Genre": "Animation, Adventure, Western", "Director": "Stanislaw D\u00fclz", "Writer": "N/A", "Actors": "Piotr Fronczewski, Andrzej Gawronski, Krzysztof Krupinski", "Plot": "Sometimes it's confusing when a cartoon series strings together a number of episodes and releases it as a feature, or makes a feature from scratch. While there were Bolek I Lolek Old West episodes, this is actually an original movie. There were episodes that featured the bad guy and sheriff, however. The plot focuses on the previous mentioned 2 characters and the boys. Lots of fun, action and visual gags. Pretty good music too. Most of the cartoon episodes didn't have dialogue. This movie did. Maybe not a good idea. Previous to this feature was, Bolek and Lolek Around the World(1977), and Bolek and Lolek at the Olympics(1983)...with a running time of 97 minutes. There was a dollar DVD of B + L released in the USA, but many of the Polish DVD's were regi\u00f3n 0 and could be played in the United States.", "Language": "Polish", "Country": "Poland", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNkMzM1NDUtYjQ0ZC00YTAzLTk4NGMtMjIxZmYzOTJjMDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU0NzkwMDg@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.5", "imdbVotes": "194", "imdbID": "tt0090760", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "28 Aug 2007", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
