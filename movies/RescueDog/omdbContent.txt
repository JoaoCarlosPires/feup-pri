So does Pluto, too proud to play a single paw-move with a jolly polar seal-pup, who simply sees the wooden thing as a fun toy, but the bumbling beast soon discovers the perils of the ice-scape extend to canines who snootily stick their snout too high to see where they tread: he stumbles into the ice, gets caught under it and passes out. The slick seal bravely dives in after him to pull his unwilling playmate out, already covered in a huge ice-block, and puts the cask to miraculously effective use on its carrier.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjNTI1ZGYtZDRkYS00ZDRkLWFhY2UtZjk5ZWEzYjc1ZTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.7", "imdbVotes": "606", "imdbID": "tt0039762", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
