Maw and Paw and their kids live on a farm and can be described as a rural family with below average intelligence (their pet pig, Milford, is regarded in the opening titles as the \"Smart One\"). At dinner, Milford answers a phone-in quiz contest correctly and wins a new car for the family. The problem is no one in the family knows how to drive it (Maw thinks the antenna is a \"new fangled clothesline\"). Eventually, Milford goes for a joyride around the farm chasing most of the residents before finally crashing into a tree reducing it to the size of a Model-T. It is now the right size for the family.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0ZGQ0YzctODgyOC00ODFmLWIzYjItNTg1NmIwNzA4NTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODMwMjk1NDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.9", "imdbVotes": "40", "imdbID": "tt0151512", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
