Kukuruku builds a castle using dolls transformed from men as building parts. The story revolves around the sorrow and terror of men who have been transfigured into dolls, and a girl named Cherry who wishes to recover the kindness in her brother, who is a student of Kukuruku. This work reminds us of the fact that \"transformation\" or \"transfiguration\" --- favorite themes of Tezuka Osamu --- involves not only material aspects, but also man's immaterial heart [Taken from AniDB]", "popularity": 1.091, "poster_path": "/xG9cJlugwqj92ooeRrRsIJw0WER.jpg", "release_date": "1983-07-16", "title": "Unico in the Island of Magic", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 7}
