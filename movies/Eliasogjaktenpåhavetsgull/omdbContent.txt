It turns out that large industrial trawlers have emptied the ocean of fish, and it looks like ordinary little fishing boats will have a hard time surviving. The trawlers belong to a new, super-modern fishing enterprise owned and run by the tough business vessel The Arctic Queen. Elias discovers what's going on, and gathers all his power in order to save the future of his tiny coastal community. He succeeds, of course, but first we will take part in a story both thrilling and funny, including a hidden Viking treasure, the most sinister villain boat of the year, a coup involving sending all the Cozy Cove fishing boats as scrap iron to China, and the cute mini-sub Dippy, which becomes a new and important acquaintance for Elias.", "Language": "Norwegian", "Country": "Norway", "Awards": "3 wins", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4OTY5ODg3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjEwNDk2NDE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.8/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.8", "imdbVotes": "71", "imdbID": "tt1692191", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
