"The movie is okay. Not remarkable, but fairly enjoyable. If you're looking for idols being cute and all singing their nice catchy songs you'll love the ending!\r\n\r\nIn the movie, lots new \"idols in training\" are introduced, which is were most of the movie focuses on - which isn't a bad thing an sich. But the other idols who got to love in the series have significant less screentime, with the exception of Haruka. On the bright side, some recurring characters from the show make appearances too (Jupiter! ^_^).""\n"
