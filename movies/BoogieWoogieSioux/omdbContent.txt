{"Title": "Boogie Woogie Sioux", "Year": "1942", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "30 Nov 1942", "Runtime": "7 min", "Genre": "Animation, Short", "Director": "Alex Lovy", "Writer": "Ben Hardaway, Milt Schaffer", "Actors": "N/A", "Plot": "First of all, what I'd like to point out about this Walter Lantz/Swing Symphony short is that interestingly enough it has and shares a plot similar to Warners'/ Merrie Melodies' Sioux Me from three years and about a couple of months earlier. But instead of getting instant downpours by using a weather/rain pill, a boogie-woogie/swing jazz band called Tommy Hawk and His 5 Scalpers are brought in to summon the showers, after another rainmaker preceding them fails. I've been wanting to watch this after coming across and learning about this for quite some time and after deciding to search on Youtube after a while of not doing so, I found it and watched last night/this early morning finally. I agree, the arrival of the new rainmaker and his band, the showers and the dancing in the rain are the best part. This has already become of favorite of mine. Like the reviewer before me stated, y'all should check out this one if y'all can overlook the stereotypes, which in my opinion, aren't to a far enough extent to be considered objectionable. The whole musical number/sequence is what I really like most. I can't wait till this makes its way onto DVD.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "N/A", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.3", "imdbVotes": "24", "imdbID": "tt0149928", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
