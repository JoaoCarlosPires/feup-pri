"Great for the kids!""\n""Just like any other Pixar movies, Toy Story 3 was great. The story flowed really well with the two Toy Story movies. And just like the two other movies, it was funny, has a lot of action and adventure, and it was really touching.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess at some point, everyone was able to relate to the story. That's why it's so great. It's great for young children and really great for adults. It's a good ending for the Toy Story movies. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is A.""\n""When I first watched this nearly a decade ago in the cinema, I believe it was (and still is) the only movie I've ever watched in 3D that I've enjoyed. I was worried that it was that great theatrical experience I'd had that coloured my opinion of _Toy Story 3_ so positively, and that it wouldn't hold up to any further scutiny. But I gotta say, on re-watch? It **absolutely** holds up. In my opinion, **strong** contender for best work Pixar's ever put out. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._""\n""Just an all around wonderful and poignant sequel that surpasses the others. Great seeing the gang working together and the voice casting was, once again, perfect. While Toy Story 4 was good, this served as a great finale. **5.0/5**""\n""I don't love <em>'Toy Story 3'</em> as much as its two predecessors. That doesn't mean that it isn't anything other than great though.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the bountiful humour and intriguing plot, while the newly-introduced toys are very good. If I had to nitpick, I don't massively like Lotso, who kinda feels to me like a slight copy of The Prospector from the 1999 sequel - with the difference here being he's the ultimate antagonist, perhaps too villainous for my own personal taste. As I said though, just a tiny criticism in the grand scheme of these productions.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks remains on top form as Woody, as do all the others including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack). Ned Beatty does a terrific job as Lotso, while Barbie and Ken are brought to life well by Jodi Benson and Michael Keaton.\r\n\r\nOnce again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>. There's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. I'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if I do agree it's still a very good new instalment.\r\n\r\nPixar and Disney keep up a pretty remarkable high quality, even in the third film of the franchise. I will never tire watching these.""\n"
