"Narrowly better than <em>'LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace'</em>, if still pretty lame.\r\n\r\nI will say the humour, whilst not good, is actually kinda decent, at least compared to what I was expecting. The story is meh, as is the entire look of this short film. A lower run time could've helped.""\n"
