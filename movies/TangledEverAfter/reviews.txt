"A decent little short.\r\n\r\nIt's practically pointless and overly short at just 6 minutes, but <em>'Tangled Ever After'</em> is amusing thanks to Pascal and Maximus. The animation is on the same level as the original 2010 film, which is nice.\r\n\r\nIs it needed? Of course not, yet it's harmless fun.""\n"
