Among the best gags in this cartoon (and there's lots of them): Sylvester walks a light wire like a tightrope walker, only to have a collective doggy-breath blow him off; Sylvester using a swing to gain access to the tree, only to have the dogs join; the cat using hypnotism to stop the dogs dead in their tracks (Tweety tricks Sylvester into revealing the secret); Sylvester disguising himself as a dog; the dogs burrowing under the pound, having accurately anticipated that Sylvester will do the same; and the dogs waiting in the tree branches waiting for Sylvester to climb the tree. The best gag, however, is saved for last Sylvester paints a white stripe down his back to make the dogs think he's a skunk.
