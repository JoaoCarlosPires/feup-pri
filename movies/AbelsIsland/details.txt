After flying some distance, Abel discovers himself alone on a river island, unable to swim due to the powerful current. Abel periodically attempts to leave the island by various means: flying on a leaf, rowing a crudely fashioned boat, etc. Meanwhile, he tries to create a normal life of sorts, even learning to enjoy a new hobby: sculpture. Still, Abel's goal is to escape the island and rejoin his wife in the city.", "popularity": 0.84, "poster_path": "/bQRtQz0A9fVk3lSvcq86wnlTDES.jpg", "release_date": "1988-06-17", "title": "Abel's Island", "video": false, "vote_average": 6, "vote_count": 1}
