He jumps on it -- once too often, and the whole stockpile falls through a knothole in the tree stump. The acorns and Scrat fall a very long way; on the way down, Scrat collects them into a huge ball. Everything hits the ground, and Scrat must pull out of the snow quickly to avoid one last acorn, which is becoming red-hot from the reentry force. It hits the Earth, with a major impact. But at least Scrat has that acorn - or does he?", "Language": "None", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Oscar.
