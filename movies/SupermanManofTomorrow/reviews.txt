"Decent enough animated movie that, even though its another origin for the Man of Steel, didn't feel stale and has a good enough story and fun side characters including Martian Manhunter and Lobo, the latter hopefully will show up in future animated movies in this new animated universe. The voice acting was okay, still not sure about Darren Criss as Clark/Superman but did like Zachary Quinto's Lex Luthor. Also the animation and design will take some getting used to as I did enjoy the New 52 designs of the last animated universe of films. **3.5/5**""\n"
