What's worse, he muscles in on Foggy's harem and reverses most of Foggy's traps and tricks. A football session with an exploding casaba melon backfires when Red returns the pass; the exploding golf balls only explode when Foghorn hits them, and the fist in the camera only pops out when Foggy examines it to figure out what went wrong. But Foghorn finally gets the last laugh with a phony telegram about an inheritance and an exploding bowling ball as a parting gift.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjc0NGMzZTctZThhYy00NzNlLWJmYjMtMmM2MzIwOTNjZTNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0MzU2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "241", "imdbID": "tt0049662", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
