Various fantastical plant-like things \"grow\" from the ground, eventually launching five spheres. The spheres drift in space while changing shapes and come back down to another setting, which eventually becomes more fantastical and symbolic than the opening one. The soundtrack has a jazz slant, with an ensemble of four saxophones and synthetic sound (i.e. sound created by drawing directly on the soundtrack).", "Language": "N/A", "Country": "Canada", "Awards": "1 win & 1 nomination.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjViNDQ3ZDYtYzYyZi00M2YzLWI2Y2UtNzFhM2UwMTQ5MzU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.9/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.9", "imdbVotes": "325", "imdbID": "tt0045028", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}
