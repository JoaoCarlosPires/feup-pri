"A pointless fourth film from the <em>'Lilo & Stitch'</em> franchise.\r\n\r\nWhile still not absolutely terrible, <em>'Leroy & Stitch'</em> isn't one that's worth watching. Not helped by a plot that is all over the place, the new characters also fail to bring any intrigue with them. I do appreciate a follow-up on the ending of <em>'Stitch! The Movie'</em>, at least.\r\n\r\nCast-wise, it's decent to hear Daveigh Chase back as Lilo while Jeff Bennett and Rob Paulsen do fine jobs as Dr. H\u00e4msterviel and Reuben. The rest, e.g. Tia Carrere (Nani), all take a backseat.\r\n\r\nI guess they were due a wholly bad film eventually, still pleasing that none of them are truly horrific though.""\n"
