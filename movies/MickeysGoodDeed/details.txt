Alas, all he gets is screws, rocks, and other useless stuff. He plays outside a rich man's window, and the spoiled brat kid inside decides he wants Pluto. Mickey isn't selling, but when his bass gets destroyed by a passing sleigh and he sees a house full of orphans with no presents, he changes his mind. Mickey plays Santa to the kids. Meanwhile, the brat has been torturing Pluto; his father finally has enough and throws Pluto out and spanks the child. Pluto and Mickey are reunited, and as a bonus, the kid has tied the Christmas turkey to Pluto's tail.\r (Also included: Chip an' Dale 1947, Lend a Paw 1941)", "popularity": 2.443, "poster_path": "/wNdvym03PSBBNZuylT7eY27DdmJ.jpg", "release_date": "1932-12-17", "title": "Mickey's Good Deed", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 31}
